Humans have always been curious about the world around them.  
The night sky with its bright celestial objects has fascinated humans since time immemorial.  
"The regular repetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons, the eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always been a source of wonder.  "
The world has an astonishing variety of materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behavior.  
The inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded to the wonder and awe of nature in different ways.  
"This human endeavor led, in course of time, to modern science and technology.  "
The word Science originates from the Latin verb Scientia meaning 'to know'.  
"The Sanskrit word Vijnan and the Arabic word Ilm convey similar meaning, namely 'knowledge'.  "
"Science, in a broad sense, is as old as human species.  "
"The early civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia and many others made vital contributions to its progress.  "
"From the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made in science in Europe.  "
"By the middle of the twentieth century, science had become a truly international enterprise, with many cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.  "
What is Science and what is the so-called Scientific Method?  
"Science is a systematic attempt to understand natural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible, and use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and control phenomena.  "
"Science is exploring, experimenting and predicting from what we see around us.  "
"The curiosity to learn about the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first step towards the discovery of science.  "
"The scientific method involves several interconnected steps: Systematic observations, controlled experiments, qualitative and quantitative reasoning, mathematical modelling, prediction and verification or falsification of theories.  "
"Speculation and conjecture also have a place in science; but ultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable, must be verified by relevant observations or experiments.  "
There is much philosophical debate about the nature and method of science that we need not discuss here.  
The interplay of theory and observation  -LRB- or experiment -RRB-  is basic to the progress of science.  
Science is ever dynamic.  
There is no 'final' theory in science and no unquestioned authority among scientists.  
Sometimes the modifications may not be drastic and may lie within the framework of existing theory.  
"Occasionally, however, the existing theory is simply unable to explain new observations.  "
This causes a major upheaval in science.  
"In the beginning of the twentieth century, it was realized that Newtonian mechanics, till then a very successful theory, could not explain some of the most basic features of atomic phenomena.  "
"Similarly, the then accepted wave picture of light failed to explain the photoelectric effect properly.  "
This led to the development of a radically new theory  -LRB- Quantum Mechanics -RRB-  to deal with atomic and molecular phenomena.  
"Just as a new experiment may suggest an alternative theoretical model, a theoretical advance may suggest what to look for in some experiments.  "
"Physics is a basic discipline in the category of Natural Sciences, which also includes other disciplines like Chemistry and Biology.  "
The word Physics comes from a Greek word meaning nature.  
Its Sanskrit equivalent is Bhautiki that is used to refer to the study of the physical world.  
A precise definition of this discipline is neither possible nor necessary.  
We can broadly describe physics as a study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in different natural phenomena.  
The scope of physics is described briefly in the next section.  
Here we remark on two principal thrusts in physics: unification and reduction.  
"In Physics, we attempt to explain diverse physical phenomena in terms of a few concepts and laws.  "
The effort is to see the physical world as manifestation of some universal laws in different domains and conditions.  
"For example, the same law of gravitation  -LRB- given by Newton -RRB-  describes the fall of an apple to the ground, the motion of the moon around the earth and the motion of planets around the sun.  "
"Similarly, the basic laws of electromagnetism  -LRB- Maxwell's equations -RRB-  govern all electric and magnetic phenomena.  "
The attempts to unify fundamental forces of nature  -LRB- section 1.4 -RRB-  reflect this same quest for unification.  
"A related effort is to derive the properties of a bigger, more complex, system from the properties and interactions of its constituent simpler parts.  "
This approach is called reductionism and is at the heart of physics.  
"For example, the subject of thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth century, deals with bulk systems in terms of macroscopic quantities such as temperature, internal energy, entropy, etc.  "
"Subsequently, the subjects of kinetic theory and statistical mechanics interpreted these quantities in terms of the properties of the molecular constituents of the bulk system.  "
"In particular, the temperature was seen to be related to the average kinetic energy of molecules of the system.  "
We can get some idea of the scope of physics by looking at its various sub-disciplines.  
"Basically, there are two domains of interest: macroscopic and microscopic.  "
"The macroscopic domain includes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial and astronomical scales.  "
"The microscopic domain includes atomic, molecular and nuclear phenomena.  "
"Classical Physics deals mainly with macroscopic phenomena and includes subjects like Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Optics and Thermodynamics.  "
"Mechanics founded on Newton’s laws of motion and the law of gravitation is concerned with the motion  -LRB- or equilibrium -RRB-  of particles, rigid and deformable bodies, and general systems of particles.  "
"The propulsion of a rocket by a jet of ejecting gases, propagation of water waves or sound waves in air, the equilibrium of a bent rod under a load, etc., are problems of mechanics.  "
Electrodynamics deals with electric and magnetic phenomena associated with charged and magnetic bodies.  
"Its basic laws were given by Coulomb, Oersted, Ampere and Faraday, and encapsulated by Maxwell in his famous set of equations.  "
Optics deals with the phenomena involving light.  
"The working of telescopes and microscopes, colors exhibited by thin films, etc., are topics in optics.  "
"Thermodynamics, in contrast to mechanics, does not deal with the motion of bodies as a whole.  "
"Rather, it deals with systems in macroscopic equilibrium and is concerned with changes in internal energy, temperature, entropy, etc., of the system through external work and transfer of heat.  "
"The efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators, the direction of a physical or chemical process, etc., are problems of interest in thermodynamics.  "
Classical physics is inadequate to handle this domain and Quantum Theory is currently accepted as the proper framework for explaining microscopic phenomena.  
"Overall, the edifice of physics is beautiful and imposing and you will appreciate it more as you pursue the subject.  "
You can now see that the scope of physics is truly vast.  
"It covers a tremendous range of magnitude of physical quantities like length, mass, time, energy, etc.  "
Terrestrial phenomena lie somewhere in the middle of this range.  
Physics is exciting in many ways.  
"To some others, the challenge in carrying out imaginative new experiments to unlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute theories, is thrilling.  "
Applied physics is equally demanding.  
Application and exploitation of physical laws to make useful devices is the most interesting and exciting part and requires great ingenuity and persistence of effort.  
What lies behind the phenomenal progress of physics in the last few centuries?  
Great progress usually accompanies changes in our basic perceptions.  
"First, it was realized that for scientific progress, only qualitative thinking, though no doubt important, is not enough.  "
"Quantitative measurement is central to the growth of science, especially physics, because the laws of nature happen to be expressible in precise mathematical equations.  "
The second most important insight was that the basic laws of physics are universal — the same laws apply in widely different contexts.  
"Lastly, the strategy of approximation turned out to be very successful.  "
Most observed phenomena in daily life are rather complicated manifestations of the basic laws.  
Scientists recognized the importance of extracting the essential features of a phenomenon from its less significant aspects.  
It is not practical to take into account all the complexities of a phenomenon in one go.  
"A good strategy is to focus first on the essential features, discover the basic principles and then introduce corrections to build a more refined theory of the phenomenon.  "
"For example, a stone and a feather dropped from the same height do not reach the ground at the same time.  "
"The reason is that the essential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free fall under gravity, is complicated by the presence of air resistance.  "
"To get the law of free fall under gravity, it is better to create a situation wherein the air resistance is negligible.  "
"We can, for example, let the stone and the feather fall through a long evacuated tube.  "
"In that case, the two objects will fall almost at the same rate, giving the basic law that acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object.  "
"The connection between physics, technology and society can be seen in many examples.  "
"Table1.1 lists some of the great physicists, their major contribution and the country of origin.  "
"You will appreciate from this table the multi-cultural, international character of the scientific endeavor.  "
Table 1.2 lists some important technologies and the principles of physics they are based on.  
"Obviously, these tables are not exhaustive.  "
"We urge you to try to add many names and items to these tables with the help of your teachers, good books and websites on science.  "
You will find that this exercise is very educative and also great fun.  
"And, assuredly, it will never end.  "
The progress of science is unstoppable!  
Physics is the study of nature and natural phenomena.  
"Physicists try to discover the rules that are operating in nature, on the basis of observations, experimentation and analysis.  "
Physics deals with certain basic rules/laws governing the natural world.  
What is the nature of physical laws?  
We shall now discuss the nature of fundamental forces and the laws that govern the diverse phenomena of the physical world.  
We all have an intuitive notion of force.  
"In our experience, force is needed to push, carry or throw objects, deform or break them.  "
"We also experience the impact of forces on us, like when a moving object hits us or we are in a merry-go - round.  "
Going from this intuitive notion to the proper scientific concept of force is not a trivial matter.  
Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong ideas about it.  
The correct notion of force was arrived at by Isaac Newton in his famous laws of motion.  
He also gave an explicit form for the force for gravitational attraction between two bodies.  
We shall learn these matters in subsequent chapters.  
There are also forces involving charged and magnetic bodies.  
"In the microscopic domain again, we have electric and magnetic forces, nuclear forces involving protons and neutrons, interatomic and intermolecular forces, etc.  "
We shall get familiar with some of these forces in later parts of this course.  
A great insight of the twentieth century physics is that these different forces occurring in different contexts actually arise from only a small number of fundamental forces in nature.  
"For example, the elastic spring force arises due to the net attraction/repulsion between the neighbouring atoms of the spring when the spring is elongated/compressed.  "
This net attraction/repulsion can be traced to the  -LRB- unbalanced -RRB-  sum of electric forces between the charged constituents of the atoms.  
"In principle, this means that the laws for 'derived' forces  -LRB- such as spring force, friction -RRB-  are not independent of the laws of fundamental forces in nature.  "
"The origin of these derived forces is, however, very complex.  "
"At the present stage of our understanding, we know of four fundamental forces in nature, which are described in brief here.  "
The gravitational force is the force of mutual attraction between any two objects by virtue of their masses.  
It is a universal force.  
"Matter, as we know, consists of elementary charged constituents like electrons and protons.  "
"Since the electromagnetic force is so much stronger than the gravitational force, it dominates all phenomena at atomic and molecular scales.  "
"The other two forces, as we shall see, operate only at nuclear scales.  "
"Thus it is mainly the electromagnetic force that governs the structure of atoms and molecules, the dynamics of chemical reactions and the mechanical, thermal and other properties of materials.  "
"It underlies the macroscopic forces like 'tension', 'friction', 'normal force', 'spring force', etc.  "
"Gravity is always attractive, while electromagnetic force can be attractive or repulsive.  "
"Another way of putting it is that mass comes only in one variety  -LRB- there is no negative mass -RRB- , but charge comes in two varieties: positive and negative charge.  "
This is what makes all the difference.  
Matter is mostly electrically neutral  -LRB- net charge is zero -RRB- .  
"Thus, electric force is largely zero and gravitational force dominates terrestrial phenomena.  "
Electric force manifests itself in atmosphere where the atoms are ionised and that leads to lightning.  
"If we reflect a little, the enormous strength of the electromagnetic force compared to gravity is evident in our daily life.  "
"When we hold a book in our hand, we are balancing the gravitational force on the book due to the huge mass of the earth by the 'normal force' provided by our hand.  "
"The latter is nothing but the net electromagnetic force between the charged constituents of our hand and the book, at the surface in contact.  "
"If electromagnetic force were not intrinsically so much stronger than gravity, the hand of the strongest man would crumble under the weight of a feather.  "
"Indeed, to be consistent, in that circumstance, we ourselves would crumble under our own weight!  "
The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons in a nucleus.  
"It is evident that without some attractive force, a nucleus will be unstable due to the electric repulsion between its protons.  "
This attractive force can not be gravitational since force of gravity is negligible compared to the electric force.  
"A new basic force must, therefore, be invoked.  "
"The strong nuclear force is the strongest of all fundamental forces, about 100 times the electromagnetic force in strength.  "
"It is charge-independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron.  "
It is responsible for the stability of nuclei.  
"The electron, it must be noted, does not experience this force.  "
"Recent developments have, however, indicated that protons and neutrons are built out of still more elementary constituents called quarks.  "
The weak nuclear force appears only in certain nuclear processes such as the β-decay of a nucleus.  
"In β-decay, the nucleus emits an electron and an uncharged particle called neutrino.  "
"The weak nuclear force is not as weak as the gravitational force, but much weaker than the strong nuclear and electromagnetic forces.  "
We remarked in section 1.1 that unification is a basic quest in physics.  
Great advances in physics often amount to unification of different theories and domains.  
Newton unified terrestrial and celestial domains under a common law of gravitation.  
The experimental discoveries of Oersted and Faraday showed that electric and magnetic phenomena are in general inseparable.  
Maxwell unified electromagnetism and optics with the discovery that light is an electromagnetic wave.  
Einstein attempted to unify gravity and electromagnetism but could not succeed in this venture.  
But this did not deter physicists from zealously pursuing the goal of unification of forces.  
Recent decades have seen much progress on this front.  
The electromagnetic and the weak nuclear force have now been unified and are seen as aspects of a single 'electro-weak' force.  
What this unification actually means can not be explained here.  
Attempts have been  -LRB- and are being -RRB-  made to unify the electro-weak and the strong force and even to unify the gravitational force with the rest of the fundamental forces.  
Many of these ideas are still speculative and inconclusive.  
Table 1.4 summarises some of the milestones in the progress towards unification of forces in nature.  
Physicists explore the universe.  
"Their investigations, based on scientific processes, range from particles that are smaller than atoms in size to stars that are very far away.  "
"In addition to finding the facts by observation and experimentation, physicists attempt to discover the laws that summarise  -LRB- often as mathematical equations -RRB-  these facts.  "
"In any physical phenomenon governed by different forces, several quantities may change with time.  "
"A remarkable fact is that some special physical quantities, however, remain constant in time.  "
They are the conserved quantities of nature.  
Understanding these conservation principles is very important to describe the observed phenomena quantitatively.  
"For motion under an external conservative force, the total mechanical energy i.e. the sum of kinetic and potential energy of a body is a constant.  "
The familiar example is the free fall of an object under gravity.  
"Both the kinetic energy of the object and its potential energy change continuously with time, but the sum remains fixed.  "
"If the object is released from rest, the initial potential energy is completely converted into the kinetic energy of the object just before it hits the ground.  "
This law restricted for a conservative force should not be confused with the general law of conservation of energy of an isolated system  -LRB- which is the basis of the First Law of Thermodynamics -RRB- .  
The concept of energy is central to physics and the expressions for energy can be written for every physical system.  
"When all forms of energy e.g., heat, mechanical energy, electrical energy etc., are counted, it turns out that energy is conserved.  "
The general law of conservation of energy is true for all forces and for any kind of transformation between different forms of energy.  
"The general law of energy conservation, however, is still applicable.  "
"The initial potential energy of the stone gets transformed into other forms of energy: heat and sound ;  -LRB- Ultimately, sound after it is absorbed becomes heat -RRB- .  "
The total energy of the system  -LRB- stone plus the surroundings -RRB-  remains unchanged.  
"The law of conservation of energy is thought to be valid across all domains of nature, from the microscopic to the macroscopic.  "
"It is routinely applied in the analysis of atomic, nuclear and elementary particle processes.  "
"At the other end, all kinds of violent phenomena occur in the universe all the time.  "
Yet the total energy of the universe  -LRB- the most ideal isolated system possible! -RRB- is believed to remain unchanged.  
"Until the advent of Einstein's theory of relativity, the law of conservation of mass was regarded as another basic conservation law of nature, since matter was thought to be indestructible.  "
"It was  -LRB- and still is -RRB-  an important principle used, for example, in the analysis of chemical reactions.  "
A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement of atoms among different molecules.  
"If the total binding energy of the reacting molecules is less than the total binding energy of the product molecules, the difference appears as heat and the reaction is exothermic.  "
The opposite is true for energy absorbing  -LRB- endothermic -RRB-  reactions.  
"However, since the atoms are merely rearranged but not destroyed, the total mass of the reactants is the same as the total mass of the products in a chemical reaction.  "
The changes in the binding energy are too small to be measured as changes in mass.  
In a nuclear process mass gets converted to energy  -LRB- or vice-versa -RRB- .  
This is the energy which is released in a nuclear power generation and nuclear explosions.  
Energy is a scalar quantity.  
But all conserved quantities are not necessarily scalars.  
The total linear momentum and the total angular momentum  -LRB- both vectors -RRB-  of an isolated system are also conserved quantities.  
These laws can be derived from Newton's laws of motion in mechanics.  
But their validity goes beyond mechanics.  
"They are the basic conservation laws of nature in all domains, even in those where Newton's laws may not be valid.  "
"Besides their great simplicity and generality, the conservation laws of nature are very useful in practice too.  "
It often happens that we can not solve the full dynamics of a complex problem involving different particles and forces.  
The conservation laws can still provide useful results.  
"In nuclear and elementary particle phenomena also, the conservation laws are important tools of analysis.  "
Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature that you will explore in more advanced courses in physics.  
"For example, an important observation is that the laws of nature do not change with time.  "
"If you perform an experiment in your laboratory today and repeat the same experiment  -LRB- on the same objects under identical conditions -RRB-  after a year, the results are bound to be the same.  "
It turns out that this symmetry of nature with respect to translation  -LRB- i.e. displacement -RRB-  in time is equivalent to the law of conservation of energy.  
"Likewise, space is homogeneous and there is no  -LRB- intrinsically -RRB-  preferred location in the universe.  "
"To put it more clearly, the laws of nature are the same everywhere in the universe.  "
Caution: the phenomena may differ from place to place because of differing conditions at different locations.  
"For example, the acceleration due to gravity at the moon is one-sixth that at the earth, but the law of gravitation is the same both on the moon and the earth.  "
This symmetry of the laws of nature with respect to translation in space gives rise to conservation of linear momentum.  
In the same way isotropy of space  -LRB- no intrinsically preferred direction in space -RRB-  underlies the law of conservation of angular momentum.  
The conservation laws of charge and other attributes of elementary particles can also be related to certain abstract symmetries.  
Symmetries of space and time and other abstract symmetries play a central role in modern theories of fundamental forces in nature.  
"Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally accepted reference standard called unit.  "
The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a number  -LRB- or numerical measure -RRB-  accompanied by a unit.  
The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units.  
The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units.  
Such units obtained for the derived quantities are called derived units.  
"A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units.  "
In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement.  
"Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS  -LRB- or British -RRB-  system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently.  "
"The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows.  "
"• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively.  "
"• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively.  "
"• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively.  "
"The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale d' Unites  -LRB- French for International System of Units -RRB- , abbreviated as SI.  "
"The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, was developed and recommended by General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971 for international usage in scientific, technical, industrial and commercial work.  "
"Because SI units used decimal system, conversions within the system are quite simple and convenient.  "
We shall follow the SI units in this book.  
"In SI, there are seven base units as given in Table 2.1.  "
The unit for plane angle is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is steradian with the symbol sr.  
Both these are dimensionless quantities.  
"Note that when mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified.  "
"These entities may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles or specified groups of such particles.  "
We employ units for some physical quantities that can be derived from the seven base units  -LRB- Appendix A 6 -RRB- .  
Some derived units in terms of the SI base units are given in  -LRB- Appendix A 6.1 -RRB- .  
These are given in Appendix A 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready reference.  
Other units retained for general use are given in Table 2.2.  
Common SI prefixes and symbols for multiples and sub-multiples are given in Appendix A2.  
You are already familiar with some direct methods for the measurement of length.  
"To measure lengths beyond these ranges, we make use of some special indirect methods.  "
Large distances such as the distance of a planet or a star from the earth can not be measured directly with a metre scale.  
An important method in such cases is the parallax method.  
This is called parallax.  
The distance between the two points of observation is called the basis.  
"In this example, the basis is the distance between the eyes.  "
We measure the angle between the two directions along which the planet is viewed at these two points.  
The ∠ASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by symbol θ is called the parallax angle or parallactic angle.  
"Having determined D, we can employ a similar method to determine the size or angular diameter of the planet.  "
It is the angle between the two directions when two diametrically opposite points of the planet are viewed through the telescope.  
"Since D is known, the diameter d of the planet can be determined using Eq.  -LRB- 2.2 -RRB- .  "
We can not use a screw gauge or similar instruments.  
Even a microscope has certain limitations.  
An optical microscope uses visible light to ' look ' at the system under investigation.  
Hence an optical microscope can not resolve particles with sizes smaller than this.  
"Instead of visible light, we can use an electron beam.  "
Electron beams can be focussed by properly designed electric and magnetic fields.  
The resolution of such an electron microscope is limited finally by the fact that electrons can also behave as waves ;  -LRB- You will learn more about this in class XII -RRB- .  
The wavelength of an electron can be as small as a fraction of an angstrom.  
Such electron microscopes with a resolution of 0.6 Å have been built.  
They can almost resolve atoms and molecules in a material.  
"In recent times, tunnelling microscopy has been developed in which again the limit of resolution is better than an angstrom.  "
It is possible to estimate the sizes of molecules.  
A simple method for estimating the molecular size of oleic acid is given below.  
The idea is to first form mono-molecular layer of oleic acid on water surface.  
"The oleic acid drop spreads into a thin, large and roughly circular film of molecular thickness on water surface.  "
"Then, we quickly measure the diameter of the thin film to get its area A.  "
Suppose we have dropped n drops in the water.  
This solution of oleic acid spreads very fast on the surface of water and forms a very thin layer of thickness t.  
"If we assume that the film has mono-molecular thickness, then this becomes the size or diameter of a molecule of oleic acid.  "
Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small in size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the center of a sphere of radius about a metre long.  
The sizes of the objects we come across in the universe vary over a very wide range.  
Table 2.6 gives the range and order of lengths and sizes of some of these objects.  
We also use certain special length units for short and large lengths.  
Mass is a basic property of matter.  
"It does not depend on the temperature, pressure or location of the object in space.  "
The SI unit of mass is kilogram  -LRB- kg -RRB- .  
The prototypes of the International standard kilogram supplied by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures  -LRB- BIPM -RRB-  are available in many other laboratories of different countries.  
"In India, this is available at the National Physical Laboratory  -LRB- NPL -RRB- , New Delhi.  "
Such standards are available in many laboratories.  
"In the cesium atomic clock, the second is taken as the time needed for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of cesium-133 atom.  "
The cesium atomic clocks are very accurate.  
In principle they provide portable standard.  
The national standard of time interval 'second' as well as the frequency is maintained through four cesium atomic clocks.  
"A cesium atomic clock is used at the National Physical Laboratory  -LRB- NPL -RRB- , New Delhi to maintain the Indian standard of time.  "
"In our country, the NPL has the responsibility of maintenance and improvement of physical standards, including that of time, frequency, etc.  "
Note that the Indian Standard Time  -LRB- IST -RRB-  is linked to this set of atomic clocks.  
The time interval of events that we come across in the universe vary over a very wide range.  
Table 2.5 gives the range and order of some typical time intervals.  
You may notice that there is an interesting coincidence between the numbers appearing in Tables 2.3 and 2.5.  
Is this a curious coincidence between these large numbers purely accidental?  
Measurement is the foundation of all experimental science and technology.  
The result of every measurement by any measuring instrument contains some uncertainty.  
This uncertainty is called error.  
"Every calculated quantity which is based on measured values, also has an error.  "
We shall distinguish between two terms: accuracy and precision.  
"The accuracy in measurement may depend on several factors, including the limit or the resolution of the measuring instrument.  "
"For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm.  "
"The first measurement has more accuracy  -LRB- because it is closer to the true value -RRB-  but less precision  -LRB- its resolution is only 0.1 cm -RRB- , while the second measurement is less accurate but more precise.  "
Thus every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement.  
"In general, the errors in measurement can be broadly classified as  -LRB- a -RRB-  systematic errors and  -LRB- b -RRB-  random errors.  "
"For example, when the same person repeats the same observation, it is very likely that he may get different readings everytime.  "
The smallest value that can be measured by the measuring instrument is called its least count.  
All the readings or measured values are good only up to this value.  
The least count error is the error associated with the resolution of the instrument.  
"For example, a vernier callipers has the least count as 0.01 cm; a spherometer may have a least count of 0.001 cm.  "
Least count error belongs to the category of random errors but within a limited size; it occurs with both systematic and random errors.  
"If we use a metre scale for measurement of length, it may have graduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or interval.  "
"Using instruments of higher precision, improving experimental techniques, etc., we can reduce the least count error.  "
"Repeating the observations several times and taking the arithmetic mean of all the observations, the mean value would be very close to the true value of the measured quantity.  "
"This is because, as explained earlier, it is reasonable to suppose that individual measurements are as likely to overestimate as to underestimate the true value of the quantity.  "
The magnitude of the difference between the true value of the quantity and the individual measurement value is called the absolute error of the measurement.  
This is denoted by -PIPE-Δa-PIPE-.  
"In absence of any other method of knowing true value, we considered arithmatic mean as the true value.  "
The Δa calculated above may be positive in certain cases and negative in some other cases.  
But absolute error -PIPE-Δa-PIPE- will always be positive.  
 -LRB- b -RRB-  The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is taken as the final or mean absolute error of the value of the physical quantity a.  
" -LRB- c -RRB-  Instead of the absolute error, we often use the relative error or the percentage error  -LRB- δa -RRB- .  "
Let us now consider an example.  
"The range of variation over the seven days of observations is 162 s for clock 1, and 31 s for clock 2.  "
The average reading of clock 1 is much closer to the standard time than the average reading of clock 2.  
"The important point is that a clock's zero error is not as significant for precision work as its variation, because a ' zero-error ' can always be easily corrected.  "
Hence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1.  
"As the periods are measured to a resolution of 0.01 s, all times are to the second decimal; it is proper to put this mean period also to the second decimal.  "
Note that the errors have the same units as the quantity to be measured.  
"As the arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is 0.11 s, there is already an error in the tenth of a second.  "
Hence there is no point in giving the period to a hundredth.  
"Note that the last numeral 6 is unreliable, since it may be anything between 5 and 7.  "
We indicate this by saying that the measurement has two significant figures.  
"In this case, the two significant figures are 2, which is reliable and 6, which has an error associated with it.  "
You will learn more about the significant figures in section 2.7.  
"If we do an experiment involving several measurements, we must know how the errors in all the measurements combine.  "
"For example, density is the ratio of the mass to the volume of the substance.  "
"If we have errors in the measurement of mass and of the sizes or dimensions, we must know what the error will be in the density of the substance.  "
"To make such estimates, we should learn how errors combine in various mathematical operations.  "
"For this, we use the following procedure.  "
"Suppose two physical quantities A and B have measured values A ± ΔA, B ± ΔB respectively where ΔA and ΔB are their absolute errors.  "
The maximum value of the error ΔZ is again ΔA + ΔB.  
"Hence the rule: When two quantities are added or subtracted, the absolute error in the final result is the sum of the absolute errors in the individual quantities.  "
Suppose Z = AB and the measured values of A and B are A ± ΔA and B ± ΔB.  
"Since ΔA and ΔB are small, we shall ignore their product.  "
You can easily verify that this is true for division also.  
"Hence the rule : When two quantities are multiplied or divided, the relative error in the result is the sum of the relative errors in the multipliers.  "
The percentage error in V is 5% and in I it is 2%.  
"Here, ΔR is expresed as 1.8 instead of 2 to keep in confirmity with the rules of significant figures.  "
Hence the rule: The relative error in a physical quantity raised to the power k is the k times the relative error in the individual quantity.  
"As discussed above, every measurement involves errors.  "
"Thus, the result of measurement should be reported in a way that indicates the precision of measurement.  "
"Normally, the reported result of measurement is a number that includes all digits in the number that are known reliably plus the first digit that is uncertain.  "
The reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as significant digits or significant figures.  
"If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain.  "
"Thus, the measured value has three significant figures.  "
"The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain.  "
"Clearly, reporting the result of measurement that includes more digits than the significant digits is superfluous and also misleading since it would give a wrong idea about the precision of measurement.  "
The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples.  
"Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument.  "
A choice of change of different units does not change the number of significant digits or figures in a measurement.  
This important remark makes most of the following observations clear.  
" -LRB- 1 -RRB-  For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures.  "
"But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or 23080 μm.  "
"All these numbers have the same number of significant figures  -LRB- digits 2, 3, 0, 8 -RRB- , namely four.  "
This shows that the location of decimal point is of no consequence in determining the number of significant figures.  
The example gives the following rules.  
All the non-zero digits are significant.  
"All the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all.  "
"If the number is less than 1, the zero  -LRB- s -RRB-  on the right of decimal point but to the left of the first non-zero digit are not significant.  "
The terminal or trailing zero  -LRB- s -RRB-  in a number without a decimal point are not significant.  
"Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has three significant figures, the trailing zero  -LRB- s -RRB-  being not significant.  "
"However, you can also see the next observation.  "
The trailing zero -LRB- s -RRB-  in a number with a decimal point are significant.  
The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.  
There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero  -LRB- s -RRB- .  
Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m.  
"It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant.  "
"If these were not, it would be superfluous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 m.  "
"To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientific notation  -LRB- in the power of 10 -RRB- .  "
"In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1  -LRB- for a≤5 -RRB-  and to 10  -LRB- for 5 _LESS_LT; a≤10 -RRB- .  "
"Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.  "
It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit.  
Now the confusion mentioned in  -LRB- a -RRB-  above disappears.  
The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures.  
"However, all zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are significant.  "
Each number in this case has four significant figures.  
"Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero  -LRB- s -RRB-  in the base number a.  "
They are always significant.  
The scientific notation is ideal for reporting measurement.  
"But if this is not adopted, we use the rules adopted in the preceding example.  "
"For a number greater than 1, without any decimal, the trailing zero  -LRB- s -RRB-  are not significant.  "
"For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero  -LRB- s -RRB-  are significant.  "
The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1  -LRB- like 0.1250 -RRB-  is never significant.  
"However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement.  "
The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits.  
It can not be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based.  
"In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained.  "
"It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision.  "
"In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures.  "
"Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to three significant figures.  "
"In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number with the least decimal places.  "
"For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic addition, is 663.821 g.  "
But the least precise measurement  -LRB- 227.2 g -RRB-  is correct to only one decimal place.  
"The final result should, therefore, be rounded off to 663.8 g.  "
"Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as.  "
They do not convey the precision of measurement properly.  
"For addition and subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal places.  "
"The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off.  "
The number of significant figures in the measured length is 4.  
The calculated area and the volume should therefore be rounded off to 4 significant figures.  
There are 3 significant figures in the measured mass whereas there are only 2 significant figures in the measured volume.  
Hence the density should be expressed to only 2 significant figures.  
The rules for determining the uncertainty or error in the number/measured quantity in arithmetic operations can be understood from the following examples.  
"If the length and breadth of a thin rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there are three significant figures in each measurement.  "
"If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also be valid to n significant figures.  "
"However, if data are subtracted, the number of significant figures can be reduced.  "
The relative error of a value of number specified to significant figures depends not only on n but also on the number itself.  
"Finally, remember that intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement.  "
These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; otherwise rounding errors can build up.  
"For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated  -LRB- after rounding off -RRB-  to the same number of significant figures  -LRB- three -RRB-  is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62.  "
"However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044 and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58.  "
The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions.  
All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities.  
"We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets  -LSB-  -RSB- .  "
An equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula is called the dimensional equation of the physical quantity.  
"Thus, the dimensional equations are the equations, which represent the dimensions of a physical quantity in terms of the base quantities.  "
"For example, the dimensional equations of volume  -LSB- V -RSB- , speed  -LSB- v -RSB- , force  -LSB- F -RSB-  and mass density  -LSB- ρ -RSB-  may be expressed as.  "
The dimensional equation can be obtained from the equation representing the relations between the physical quantities.  
"The recognition of concepts of dimensions, which guide the description of physical behavior is of basic importance as only those physical quantities can be added or subtracted which have the same dimensions.  "
"A thorough understanding of dimensional analysis helps us in deducing certain relations among different physical quantities and checking the derivation, accuracy and dimensional consistency or homogeneity of various mathematical expressions.  "
We can cancel identical units in the numerator and denominator.  
The same is true for dimensions of a physical quantity.  
"Similarly, physical quantities represented by symbols on both sides of a mathematical equation must have the same dimensions.  "
The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions.  
"In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities.  "
"Thus, velocity can not be added to force, or an electric current can not be subtracted from the thermodynamic temperature.  "
This simple principle called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation.  
"If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong.  "
"Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation.  "
"However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations.  "
It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions.  
"The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless.  "
Now we can test the dimensional consistency or homogeneity of the equation.  
"Thus, a dimensionally correct equation need not be actually an exact  -LRB- correct -RRB-  equation, but a dimensionally wrong  -LRB- incorrect -RRB-  or inconsistent equation must be wrong.  "
The dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and hence the equation is dimensionally correct.  
Every correct formula or equation must have the same dimensions on both sides of the equation.  
"Also, only quantities with the same physical dimensions can be added or subtracted.  "
The quantity on the right side of  -LRB- e -RRB-  has no proper dimensions since two quantities of different dimensions have been added.  
"Note that dimensional arguments can not tell which of the two,  -LRB- b -RRB-  or  -LRB- d -RRB- , is the correct formula.  "
"For this, one must turn to the actual definition of kinetic energy  -LRB- see Chapter 6 -RRB- .  "
The correct formula for kinetic energy is given by  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
The method of dimensions can sometimes be used to deduce relation among the physical quantities.  
Let us take an example.  
"The dependence of time period T on the quantities l, g and m as a product may be written as.  "
"where k is dimensionless constant and x, y and z are the exponents.  "
Note that value of constant k can not be obtained by the method of dimensions.  
"Here it does not matter if some number multiplies the right side of this formula, because that does not affect its dimensions.  "
Dimensional analysis is very useful in deducing relations among the interdependent physical quantities.  
"However, dimensionless constants can not be obtained by this method.  "
"The method of dimensions can only test the dimensional validity, but not the exact relationship between physical quantities in any equation.  "
It does not distinguish between the physical quantities having same dimensions.  
A number of exercises at the end of this chapter will help you develop skill in dimensional analysis.  
Motion is common to everything in the universe.  
"We walk, run and ride a bicycle.  "
"Even when we are sleeping, air moves into and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and veins.  "
We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing down a dam.  
Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other.  
The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year.  
"The sun itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving within its local group of galaxies.  "
Motion is change in position of an object with time.  
How does the position change with time?  
"In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion.  "
"For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration.  "
"We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion.  "
"For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained.  "
"Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.  "
"In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects.  "
This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time.  
"In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.  "
"In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion.  "
What causes motion described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the subject matter of Chapter 5.  
Earlier you learned that motion is change in position of an object with time.  
"In order to specify position, we need to use a reference point and a set of axes.  "
"It is convenient to choose a rectangular coordinate system consisting of three mutually perpenducular axes, labeled X -, Y -, and Z - axes.  "
The point of intersection of these three axes is called origin  -LRB- O -RRB-  and serves as the reference point.  
"The coordinates  -LRB- x, y, z -RRB-  of an object describe the position of the object with respect to this coordinate system.  "
"To measure time, we position a clock in this system.  "
This coordinate system along with a clock constitutes a frame of reference.  
"If one or more coordinates of an object change with time, we say that the object is in motion.  "
"Otherwise, the object is said to be at rest with respect to this frame of reference.  "
The choice of a set of axes in a frame of reference depends upon the situation.  
"For example, for describing motion in one dimension, we need only one axis.  "
"To describe motion in two/three dimensions, we need a set of two/three axes.  "
Description of an event depends on the frame of reference chosen for the description.  
"For example, when you say that a car is moving on a road, you are describing the car with respect to a frame of reference attached to you or to the ground.  "
"But with respect to a frame of reference attached with a person sitting in the car, the car is at rest.  "
"To describe motion along a straight line, we can choose an axis, say X-axis, so that it coincides with the path of the object.  "
"We then measure the position of the object with reference to a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown in Fig. 3.1.  "
"Positions to the right of O are taken as positive and to the left of O, as negative.  "
"Following this convention, the position coordinates of point P and Q in Fig. 3.1 are +360 m and +240 m.  "
"Similarly, the position coordinate of point R is — 120 m.  "
Consider the motion of a car along a straight line.  
"We choose the x-axis such that it coincides with the path of the car's motion and origin of the axis as the point from where the car started moving, i.e. the car was at x=0 at t=0.  "
"Let P, Q and R represent the positions of the car at different instants of time.  "
Consider two cases of motion.  
"In the first case, the car moves from O to P.   "
Then the distance moved by the car is OP = +360 m.   
This distance is called the path length traversed by the car.  
"In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q.   "
"During this course of motion, the path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m +  -LRB- +120 m -RRB-  = + 480 m.  "
Path length is a scalar quantity — a quantity that has a magnitude only and no direction  -LRB- see Chapter 4 -RRB- .  
It is useful to define another quantity displacement as the change in position.  
Displacement has both magnitude and direction.  
Such quantities are represented by vectors.  
You will read about vectors in the next chapter.  
"Presently, we are dealing with motion along a straight line  -LRB- also called rectilinear motion -RRB-  only.  "
The displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and is directed in the positive x direction as indicated by the + sign.  
"Similarly, the displacement of the car from P to Q is 240 m — 360 m = — 120 m.   "
The negative sign indicates the direction of displacement.  
"Thus, it is not necessary to use vector notation for discussing motion of objects in one-dimension.  "
The magnitude of displacement may or may not be equal to the path length traversed by an object.  
"For example, for motion of the car from O to P, the path length is +360 m and the displacement is +360 m.   "
"In this case, the magnitude of displacement  -LRB- 360 m -RRB-  is equal to the path length  -LRB- 360 m -RRB- .  "
"Thus, the magnitude of displacement  -LRB- 240 m -RRB-  is not equal to the path length  -LRB- 480 m -RRB- .  "
The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is not zero.  
"For example, if the car starts from O, goes to P and then returns to O, the final position coincides with the initial position and the displacement is zero.  "
"However, the path length of this journey is OP + PO = 360 m + 360 m = 720 m.   "
Motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph as you have already learned about it.  
Such a graph is a powerful tool to represent and analyze different aspects of motion of an object.  
"Let us first consider the simple case in which an object is stationary, e.g. a car standing still at x = 40 m.   "
"The position-time graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis, as shown in Fig. 3.2  -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
"If an object moving along the straight line covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion along a straight line.  "
Fig. 3.2  -LRB- b -RRB-  shows the position-time graph of such a motion.  
Then the brakes are applied and the car stops at t = 20 s and x = 296 m.   
The position-time graph for this case is shown in Fig. 3.3.  
We shall refer to this graph in our discussion in the following sections.  
"When an object is in motion, its position changes with time.  "
But how fast is the position changing with time and in what direction?  
"To describe this, we define the quantity average velocity.  "
"Like displacement, average velocity is also a vector quantity.  "
Consider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3 The portion of the x-t graph between t = 0 s and t = 8 s is blown up and shown in Fig. 3.4.  
The average velocity can be positive or negative depending upon the sign of the displacement.  
Average velocity as defined above involves only the displacement of the object.  
We have seen earlier that the magnitude of displacement may be different from the actual path length.  
"To describe the rate of motion over the actual path, we introduce another quantity called average speed.  "
But it does not tell us in what direction an object is moving.  
"Thus, it is always positive  -LRB- in contrast to the average velocity which can be positive or negative -RRB- .  "
"If the motion of an object is along a straight line and in the same direction, the magnitude of displacement is equal to the total path length.  "
"In that case, the magnitude of average velocity is equal to the average speed.  "
"Thus, in this case the average speed is equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.  "
Let us take Δt = 2 s centred at t = 4 s.   
It is difficult to show this process graphically.  
"But if we use numerical method to obtain the value of the velocity, the meaning of the limiting process becomes clear.  "
The graphical method for the determination of the instantaneous velocity is always not a convenient method.  
"From Fig. 3.7, we note that during the period t = 10 s to 18 s the velocity is constant.  "
"Between period t = 18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly decreasing and during the period t = 0 s to t = 10 s, it is increasing.  "
"Note that for uniform motion, velocity is the same as the average velocity at all instants.  "
Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the magnitude of velocity.  
"For the v-t curve shown in Fig. 3.7, we can obtain acceleration at every instant of time.  "
The resulting a-t curve is shown in Fig. 3.8.  
We see that the acceleration is nonuniform over the period 0 s to 10 s.  
"When the acceleration is uniform, obviously, it equals the average acceleration over that period.  "
"Since velocity is a quantity having both magnitude and direction, a change in velocity may involve either or both of these factors.  "
"Acceleration, therefore, may result from a change in speed  -LRB- magnitude -RRB- , a change in direction or changes in both.  "
"Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive, negative or zero.  "
"Although acceleration can vary with time, our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration.  "
Let us see how velocity-time graph looks like for some simple cases.  
" -LRB- a -RRB-  An object is moving in a positive direction with a positive acceleration, for example the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3 between t = 0 s and t = 10 s.  "
" -LRB- b -RRB-  An object is moving in positive direction with a negative acceleration, for example, motion of the car in Fig 3.3 between t = 18 s and 20 s.  "
" -LRB- c -RRB-  An object is moving in negative direction with a negative acceleration, for example the motion of a car moving from O in Fig. 3.1 in negative x-direction with increasing speed.  "
A general proof of this statement requires use of calculus.  
"We can, however, see that it is true for the simple case of an object moving with constant velocity u.  "
Its velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 3.11.  
"Therefore, area = u×T = uT which is the displacement in this time interval.  "
How come in this case an area is equal to a distance?  
Think!  
"Note the dimensions of quantities on the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at the answer.  "
"In any realistic situation, the functions will be differentiable at all points and the graphs will be smooth.  "
What this means physically is that acceleration and velocity can not change values abruptly at an instant.  
Changes are always continuous.  
Area between instants O and t = Area of triangle ABC + Area of rectangle OACD.  
"As explained in the previous section, the area under v-t curve represents the displacement.  "
Equation  -LRB- 3.7 -RRB-  can also be written as.  
The advantage of this method is that it can be used for motion with non-uniform acceleration also.  
"Now, we shall use these equations to some important cases.  "
" -LRB- a -RRB- Let us take the y-axis in the vertically upward direction with zero at the ground, as shown in Fig. 3.13.  "
 -LRB- b -RRB-  We can solve this part of the problem in two ways.  
Note carefully the methods used.  
This is the time in going from A to B.  
"From B, or the point of the maximum height, the ball falls freely under the acceleration due to gravity.  "
The ball is moving in negative y direction.  
Note that the second method is better since we do not have to worry about the path of the motion as the motion is under constant acceleration.  
An object released near the surface of the Earth is accelerated downward under the influence of the force of gravity.  
The magnitude of acceleration due to gravity is represented by g.  
"If air resistance is neglected, the object is said to be in free fall.  "
Free fall is thus a case of motion with uniform acceleration.  
"We assume that the motion is in y-direction, more correctly in — y-direction because we choose upward direction as positive.  "
These equations give the velocity and the distance traveled as a function of time and also the variation of velocity with distance.  
"The variation of acceleration, velocity, and distance, with time have been plotted in Fig. 3.14 -LRB- a -RRB- , -LRB- b -RRB-  and  -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
This law was established by Galileo Galilei  -LRB- 1564-1642 -RRB-  who was the first to make quantitative studies of free fall.  
"Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to the square of the initial velocity.  "
Doubling the initial velocity increases the stopping distance by a factor of 4  -LRB- for the same deceleration -RRB- .  
"Stopping distance is an important factor considered in setting speed limits, for example, in school zones.  "
You must be familiar with the experience of traveling in a train and being overtaken by another train moving in the same direction as you are.  
"In case both the trains have the same velocity with respect to the ground, then to you the other train would seem to be not moving at all.  "
"To understand such observations, we now introduce the concept of relative velocity.  "
" -LRB- Unless otherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in this chapter are measured with reference to the ground -RRB- .  "
"If the objects under consideration are two trains, then for a person sitting on either of the two, the other train seems to go very fast.  "
"In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position, displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to describe the motion of an object along a straight line.  "
"We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and - signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible.  "
"But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions  -LRB- a plane -RRB-  or three dimensions  -LRB- space -RRB- , we need to use vectors to describe the above - mentioned physical quantities.  "
"Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors.  "
What is a vector?  
"How to add, subtract and multiply vectors?  "
What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number?  
We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane.  
We then discuss motion of an object in a plane.  
"As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion.  "
Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.  
We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.  
The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.  
"In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors.  "
"Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar.  "
A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only.  
"It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit.  "
"Examples are: the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened.  "
"Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided just as the ordinary numbers.  "
The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar.  
Take another example: the maximum and minimum temperatures on a particular day are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively.  
A vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the triangle law of addition or equivalently the parallelogram law of addition.  
"So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction.  "
"Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force.  "
"To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book.  "
"Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol v.  "
"Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter,  "
"The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by -PIPE-v-PIPE- = v.  "
"Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points.  "
This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussing motion along a straight line.  
"Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and only if, they have the same magnitude and the same direction.  "
Figure 4.2 -LRB- a -RRB-  shows two equal vectors A and B.  
We can easily check their equality.  
"Shift B parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that of A, i.e. Q coincides with O.  "
"Then, since their tips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are said to be equal.  "
"In general, equality is indicated as A=B.  "
"Note that in Fig. 4.2 -LRB- b -RRB- , vectors A′ and B′ have the same magnitude but they are not equal because they have different directions.  "
"Even if we shift B′ parallel to itself so that its tail Q′ coincides with the tail O′ of A′, the tip S′ of B′ does not coincide with the tip P′ of A′.  "
"For example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant vector 2A is in the same direction as A and has a magnitude twice of -PIPE-A-PIPE- as shown in Fig. 4.3 -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
Multiplying a vector A by a negative number λ gives a vector λA whose direction is opposite to the direction of A and whose magnitude is -λ times -PIPE-A-PIPE-.  
"Multiplying a given vector A by negative numbers, say — 1 and — 1.5, gives vectors as shown in Fig 4.3 -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
The factor λ by which a vector A is multiplied could be a scalar having its own physical dimension.  
"Then, the dimension of λA is the product of the dimensions of λ and A.  "
"For example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector by duration  -LRB- of time -RRB- , we get a displacement vector.  "
"As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently, the parallelogram law of addition.  "
We shall now describe this law of addition using the graphical method.  
Let us consider two vectors A and B that lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
The lengths of the line segments representing these vectors are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.  
"To find the sum A+B, we place vector B so that its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in Fig. 4.4 -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
"Then, we join the tail of A to the head of B.  "
"This line OQ represents a vector R, that is, the sum of the vectors A and B.  "
"Since, in this procedure of vector addition, vectors are arranged head to tail, this graphical method is called the head-to-tail method.  "
"The two vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, so this method is also known as triangle method of vector addition.  "
"If we find the resultant of B + A as in Fig. 4.4 -LRB- c -RRB- , the same vector R is obtained.  "
The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law as illustrated in Fig. 4.4 -LRB- d -RRB- .  
What is the result of adding two equal and opposite vectors?  
Consider two vectors A and -A shown in Fig. 4.3 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
Their sum is A+ -LRB- -A -RRB- .  
"Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the same, but the directions are opposite, the resultant vector has zero magnitude and is represented by 0 called a null vector or a zero vector.  "
"Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its direction can not be specified.  "
The null vector also results when we multiply a vector A by the number zero.  
What is the physical meaning of a zero vector?  
Consider the position and displacement vectors in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.1 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"Now suppose that an object which is at P at time t, moves to P′ and then comes back to P.  "
"Then, what is its displacement?  "
"Since the initial and final positions coincide, the displacement is a ""null vector "".  "
Subtraction of vectors can be defined in terms of addition of vectors.  
We define the difference of two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors A and -B.  
It is shown in Fig 4.5.  
We can also use the parallelogram method to find the sum of two vectors.  
Suppose we have two vectors A and B.  
"To add these vectors, we bring their tails to a common origin O as shown in Fig. 4.6 -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
Then we draw a line from the head of A parallel to B and another line from the head of B parallel to A to complete a parallelogram OQSP.  
Now we join the point of the intersection of these two lines to the origin O.  
The resultant vector R is directed from the common origin O along the diagonal  -LRB- OS -RRB-  of the parallelogram  -LSB- Fig. 4.6 -LRB- b -RRB-  -RSB- .  
"In Fig.4.6  -LRB- c -RRB- , the triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A and B and we see that the two methods yield the same result.  "
"Thus, the two methods are equivalent.  "
"Therefore, the boy should hold his umbrella in the vertical plane at an angle of about 19° with the vertical towards the east.  "
Let a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a plane with different directions and let A be another vector in the same plane.  
A can be expressed as a sum of two vectors — one obtained by multiplying a by a real number and the other obtained by multiplying b by another real number.  
"To see this, let O and P be the tail and head of the vector A.  "
"Then, through O, draw a straight line parallel to a, and through P, a straight line parallel to b.  "
Let them intersect at Q.  
where λ and µ are real numbers.  
We say that A has been resolved into two component vectors λa and μb along a and b respectively.  
Using this method one can resolve a given vector into two component vectors along a set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same plane.  
It is convenient to resolve a general vector along the axes of a rectangular coordinate system using vectors of unit magnitude.  
These are called unit vectors that we discuss now.  
Unit vectors: A unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and points in a particular direction.  
It has no dimension and unit.  
It is used to specify a direction only.  
We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition.  
"So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies.  "
"In this chapter, we turn to this basic question.  "
Let us first guess the answer based on our common experience.  
"To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.  "
"To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push.  "
A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects.  
A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it.  
"Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.  "
"Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion.  "
You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion.  
"In these examples, the external agency of force  -LRB- hands, wind, stream, etc -RRB-  is in contact with the object.  "
This is not always necessary.  
A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth.  
A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.  
This shows that external agencies  -LRB- e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces -RRB-  can exert force on a body even from a distance.  
"In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force.  "
The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body.  
So far so good.  
But what if a body is moving uniformly  -LRB- e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab -RRB- ?  
Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion?  
The question posed above appears to be simple.  
"However, it took ages to answer it.  "
"Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science.  "
"The Greek thinker, Aristotle  -LRB- 384 B.C. — 322 B.C. -RRB- , held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving.  "
"According to this view, for example, an arrow shot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind the arrow keeps pushing it.  "
The view was part of an elaborate framework of ideas developed by Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.  
Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now known to be wrong and need not concern us.  
"For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion.  "
"Aristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall see.  "
"However, it is a natural view that anyone would hold from common experience.  "
"If it releases the string, it comes to rest.  "
This experience is common to most terrestrial motion.  
External forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in motion.  
"Left to themselves, all bodies eventually come to rest.  "
What is the flaw in Aristotle's argument?  
The answer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion.  
"To counter this force, the child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion.  "
"When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force  -LRB- friction -RRB-  by the floor.  "
"The corollary is: if there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion.  "
The opposing forces such as friction  -LRB- solids -RRB-  and viscous forces  -LRB- for fluids -RRB-  are always present in the natural world.  
This explains why forces by external agencies are necessary to overcome the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform motion.  
Now we understand where Aristotle went wrong.  
He coded this practical experience in the form of a basic argument.  
"To get at the true law of nature for forces and motion, one has to imagine a world in which uniform motion is possible with no frictional forces opposing.  "
This is what Galileo did.  
Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane.  
"Objects  -LRB- i -RRB-  moving down an inclined plane accelerate, while those  -LRB- ii -RRB-  moving up retard.  "
"Galileo concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity.  "
Another experiment by Galileo leading to the same conclusion involves a double inclined plane.  
A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls down and climbs up the other.  
"If the planes are smooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the same as the initial height  -LRB- a little less but never greater -RRB- .  "
"In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height.  "
"If the slope of the second plane is decreased and the experiment repeated, the ball will still reach the same height, but in doing so, it will travel a longer distance.  "
"In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero  -LRB- i.e. is a horizontal -RRB-  the ball travels an infinite distance.  "
"In other words, its motion never ceases.  "
"This is, of course, an idealised situation.  "
"In practice, the ball does come to a stop after moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane, because of the opposing force of friction which can never be totally eliminated.  "
"However, if there were no friction, the ball would continue to move with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.  "
"Galileo thus, arrived at a new insight on motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who followed him.  "
The state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion  -LRB- motion with constant velocity -RRB-  are equivalent.  
"In both cases, there is no net force acting on the body.  "
It is incorrect to assume that a net force is needed to keep a body in uniform motion.  
"To summarise, if the net external force is zero, a body at rest continues to remain at rest and a body in motion continues to move with a uniform velocity.  "
This property of the body is called inertia.  
Inertia means ' resistance to change '.  
"A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion, unless an external force compels it to change that state.  "
"Galileo's simple, but revolutionary ideas dethroned Aristotelian mechanics.  "
A new mechanics had to be developed.  
"This task was accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.  "
Newton built on Galileo's ideas and laid the foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws of motion that go by his name.  
The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration.  
"The first law of motion can, therefore, be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero.  "
Acceleration can be non zero only if there is a net external force on the body.  
Two kinds of situations are encountered in the application of this law in practice.  
"In some examples, we know that the net external force on the object is zero.  "
In that case we can conclude that the acceleration of the object is zero. 
"For example, a spaceship out in interstellar space, far from all other objects and with all its rockets turned off, has no net external force acting on it.  "
"Its acceleration, according to the First Law, must be zero.  "
"If it is in motion, it must continue to move with a uniform velocity.  "
"More often, however, we do not know all the forces to begin with.  "
Gravity is everywhere.  
"For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every object experiences gravitational force due to the earth.  "
"Also objects in motion generally experience friction, viscous drag, etc.  "
Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface .  
"It is subject to two external forces: the force due to gravity  -LRB- i.e. its weight W -RRB-  acting downward and the upward force on the book by the table, the normal force R.  "
R is a self-adjusting force.  
This is an example of the kind of situation mentioned above.  
The forces are not quite known fully but the state of motion is known.  
We observe the book to be at rest.  
"Therefore, we conclude from the first law that the magnitude of R equals that of W.  "
"A statement often encountered is: ""Since W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book is at rest "".  "
This is incorrect reasoning.  
"The correct statement is: ""Since the book is observed to be at rest, the net external force on it must be zero, according to the first law.  "
"This implies that the normal force R must be equal and opposite to the weight W "".  "
"Consider the motion of a car starting from rest, picking up speed and then moving on a smooth straight road with uniform speed.  "
"When the car is stationary, there is no net force acting on it.  "
"During pick-up, it accelerates.  "
This must happen due to a net external force.  
"Note, it has to be an external force.  "
The acceleration of the car can not be accounted for by any internal force.  
"This might sound surprising, but it is true.  "
The only conceivable external force along the road is the force of friction.  
It is the frictional force that accelerates the car as a whole  -LRB- You will learn about friction in section 5.9 -RRB- .  
"When the car moves with constant velocity, there is no net external force.  "
The property of inertia contained in the First law is evident in many situations.  
Suppose we are standing in a stationary bus and the driver starts the bus suddenly.  
We get thrown backward with a jerk.  
Why?  
Our feet are in touch with the floor.  
"If there were no friction, we would remain where we were, while the floor of the bus would simply slip forward under our feet and the back of the bus would hit us.  "
"However, fortunately, there is some friction between the feet and the floor.  "
"If the start is not too sudden, i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional force would be enough to accelerate our feet along with the bus.  "
But our body is not strictly a rigid body.  
"It is deformable, i.e. it allows some relative displacement between different parts.  "
"What this means is that while our feet go with the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is due to inertia.  "
"Relative to the bus, therefore, we are thrown backward.  "
"As soon as that happens, however, the muscular forces on the rest of the body  -LRB- by the feet -RRB-  come into play to move the body along with the bus.  "
A similar thing happens when the bus suddenly stops.  
Our feet stop due to the friction which does not allow relative motion between the feet and the floor of the bus.  
But the rest of the body continues to move forward due to inertia.  
We are thrown forward.  
The restoring muscular forces again come into play and bring the body to rest.  
By the first law of motion the acceleration of the astronaut is zero.  
The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero.  
The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body.  
It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body.  
The following common experiences indicate the importance of this quantity for considering the effect of force on motion.  
Suppose a light-weight vehicle  -LRB- say a small car -RRB-  and a heavy weight vehicle  -LRB- say a loaded truck -RRB-  are parked on a horizontal road.  
We all know that a much greater force is needed to push the truck than the car to bring them to the same speed in same time.  
"If two stones, one light and the other heavy, are dropped from the top of a building, a person on the ground will find it easier to catch the light stone than the heavy stone.  "
The mass of a body is thus an important parameter that determines the effect of force on its motion.  
Speed is another important parameter to consider.  
"A bullet fired by a gun can easily pierce human tissue before it stops, resulting in casualty.  "
The same bullet fired with moderate speed will not cause much damage.  
"Thus for a given mass, the greater the speed, the greater is the opposing force needed to stop the body in a certain time.  "
"Taken together, the product of mass and velocity, that is momentum, is evidently a relevant variable of motion.  "
"The greater the change in the momentum in a given time, the greater is the force that needs to be applied.  "
"A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball coming in with great speed far more easily than a novice, who can hurt his hands in the act.  "
One reason is that the cricketer allows a longer time for his hands to stop the ball.  
"As you may have noticed, he draws in the hands backward in the act of catching the ball.  "
"The novice, on the other hand, keeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the ball almost instantly.  "
"In the examples so far, momentum and change in momentum both have the same direction.  "
But this is not always the case.  
"Suppose a stone is rotated with uniform speed in a horizontal plane by means of a string, the magnitude of momentum is fixed, but its direction changes.  "
A force is needed to cause this change in momentum vector.  
This force is provided by our hand through the string.  
"Experience suggests that our hand needs to exert a greater force if the stone is rotated at greater speed or in a circle of smaller radius, or both.  "
This corresponds to greater acceleration or equivalently a greater rate of change in momentum vector.  
This suggests that the greater the rate of change in momentum vector the greater is the force applied.  
The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.  
"According to the Second Law, where k is a constant of proportionality.  "
The unit of force has not been defined so far.  
Let us note at this stage some important points about the second law.   
"1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = 0.  "
The second Law is obviously consistent with the first law.  
2. The second law of motion is a vector law.  
"This means that if a force is not parallel to the velocity of the body, but makes some angle with it, it changes only the component of velocity along the direction of force.  "
The component of velocity normal to the force remains unchanged.  
"For example, in the motion of a projectile under the vertical gravitational force, the horizontal component of velocity remains unchanged.  "
3. The second law of motion given by Eq.  -LRB- 5.5 -RRB-  is applicable to a single point particle.  
The force F in the law stands for the net external force on the particle and a stands for acceleration of the particle.  
"It turns out, however, that the law in the same form applies to a rigid body or, even more generally, to a system of particles.  "
"In that case, F refers to the total external force on the system and a refers to the acceleration of the system as a whole.  "
"More precisely, a is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system.  "
Any internal forces in the system are not to be included in F.  
"Acceleration here and now is determined by the force here and now, not by any history of the motion of the particle.  "
"The actual resistive force, and therefore, retardation of the bullet may not be uniform.  "
"The answer therefore, only indicates the average resistive force.  "
We sometimes encounter examples where a large force acts for a very short duration producing a finite change in momentum of the body.  
"Often, in these situations, the force and the time duration are difficult to ascertain separately.  "
"However, the product of force and time, which is the change in momentum of the body remains a measurable quantity.  "
This product is called impulse.  
A large force acting for a short time to produce a finite change in momentum is called an impulsive.  
"In the history of science, impulsive forces were put in a conceptually different category from ordinary forces.  "
Newtonian mechanics has no such distinction.  
Impulsive force is like any other force — except that it is large and acts for a short time.  
"This is an example where the force on the ball by the batsman and the time of contact of the ball and the bat are difficult to know, but the impulse is readily calculated.  "
The second law relates the external force on a body to its acceleration.  
What is the origin of the external force on the body?  
What agency provides the external force?  
The simple answer in Newtonian mechanics is that the external force on a body always arises due to some other body.  
Consider a pair of bodies A and B.   
B gives rise to an external force on A.   
A natural question is: Does A in turn give rise to an external force on B?  
"In some examples, the answer seems clear.  "
"If you press a coiled spring, the spring is compressed by the force of your hand.  "
The compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your hand and you can feel it.  
But what if the bodies are not in contact?  
The earth pulls a stone downwards due to gravity.  
Does the stone exert a force on the earth?  
The answer is not obvious since we hardly see the effect of the stone on the earth.  
"The answer according to Newton is: Yes, the stone does exert an equal and opposite force on the earth.  "
We do not notice it since the earth is very massive and the effect of a small force on its motion is negligible.  
"Thus, according to Newtonian mechanics, force never occurs singly in nature.  "
Force is the mutual interaction between two bodies.  
Forces always occur in pairs.  
"Further, the mutual forces between two bodies are always equal and opposite.  "
This idea was expressed by Newton in the form of the third law of motion.  
The force on A by B and the force on B by A act at the same instant.  
"By the same reasoning, any one of them may be called action and the other reaction.  "
"3. Action and reaction forces act on different bodies, not on the same body.  "
Consider a pair of bodies A and B.   
According to the third law.  
"Thus if we are considering the motion of any one body  -LRB- A or B -RRB- , only one of the two forces is relevant.  "
It is an error to add up the two forces and claim that the net force is zero.  
They add up to give a null force.  
Internal forces in a body or a system of particles thus cancel away in pairs.  
This is an important fact that enables the second law to be applicable to a body or a system of particles.  
This answer is wrong.  
The force on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases.  
How to find the force on the wall?  
"Let u be the speed of each ball before and after collision with the wall, and m the mass of each ball.  "
Impulse and force are in the same direction.  
"Clearly, from above, the force on the ball due to the wall is normal to the wall, along the negative x-direction.  "
"Using Newton's third law of motion, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x-direction.  "
The magnitude of force can not be ascertained since the small time taken for the collision has not been specified in the problem.  
The direction of impulse  -LRB- and force -RRB-  is the same as in  -LRB- a -RRB-  and is normal to the wall along the negative x direction.  
"As before, using Newton's third law, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x direction.  "
The second and the third laws of motion lead to an important consequence: the law of conservation of momentum.  
Take a familiar example.  
A bullet is fired from a gun.  
"If the force on the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun by the bullet is — F, according to the third law.  "
The two forces act for a common interval of time Δt.   
"According to the second law, F Δt is the change in momentum of the bullet and — F Δt is the change in momentum of the gun.  "
"Since initially, both are at rest, the change in momentum equals the final momentum for each.  "
This fact is known as the law of conservation of momentum.  
The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is conserved.  
An important example of the application of the law of conservation of momentum is the collision of two bodies.  
Notice that this is true whether the collision is elastic or inelastic.  
"In elastic collisions, there is a second condition that the total initial kinetic energy of the system equals the total final kinetic energy.  "
Equilibrium of a particle in mechanics refers to the situation when the net external force on the particle is zero.  
"According to the first law, this means that, the particle is either at rest or in uniform motion.  "
"As seen in Fig. 5.7, the three forces in equilibrium can be represented by the sides of a triangle with the vector arrows taken in the same sense.  "
The result can be generalised to any number of forces.  
Figures 5.8  -LRB- b -RRB-  and 5.8  -LRB- c -RRB-  are known as free-body diagrams.  
Figure 5.8  -LRB- b -RRB-  is the free-body diagram of W and Fig. 5.8  -LRB- c -RRB-  is the free-body diagram of point P.  
The horizontal and vertical components of the resultant force must vanish separately.  
Note the answer does not depend on the length of the rope  -LRB- assumed massless -RRB-  nor on the point at which the horizontal force is applied.  
"In mechanics, we encounter several kinds of forces.  "
"The gravitational force is, of course, all pervasive.  "
Every object on the earth experiences the force of gravity due to the earth.  
Gravity also governs the motion of celestial bodies.  
The gravitational force can act at a distance without the need of any intervening medium.  
All the other forces common in mechanics are contact forces.  
"As the name suggests, a contact force on an object arises due to contact with some other object: solid or fluid.  "
The component of contact force normal to the surfaces in contact is called normal reaction.  
The component parallel to the surfaces in contact is called friction.  
Contact forces arise also when solids are in contact with fluids.  
"For example, for a solid immersed in a fluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.  "
"The viscous force, air resistance, etc are also examples of contact forces.  "
Two other common forces are tension in a string and the force due to spring.  
"When a spring is compressed or extended by an external force, a restoring force is generated.  "
This force is usually proportional to the compression or elongation  -LRB- for small displacements -RRB- .  
The negative sign denotes that the force is opposite to the displacement from the unstretched state.  
"For an inextensible string, the force constant is very high.  "
The restoring force in a string is called tension.  
It is customary to use a constant tension T throughout the string.   
This assumption is true for a string of negligible mass.  
"In Chapter 1, we learned that there are four fundamental forces in nature.  "
"Of these, the weak and strong forces appear in domains that do not concern us here.  "
Only the gravitational and electrical forces are relevant in the context of mechanics.  
The different contact forces of mechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise from electrical forces.  
This may seem surprising since we are talking of uncharged and non - magnetic bodies in mechanics.  
"The detailed microscopic origin of these forces is, however, complex and not useful for handling problems in mechanics at the macroscopic scale.  "
This is why they are treated as different types of forces with their characteristic properties determined empirically.  
Let us return to the example of a body of mass m at rest on a horizontal table.  
The force of gravity  -LRB- mg -RRB-  is canceled by the normal reaction force  -LRB- N -RRB-  of the table.  
Now suppose a force F is applied horizontally to the body.  
We know from experience that a small applied force may not be enough to move the body.  
Note that static friction does not exist by itself.  
"When there is no applied force, there is no static friction.  "
It comes into play the moment there is an applied force.  
"Hence, it is called.  "
Static friction opposes impending motion.  
"The term impending motion means motion that would take place  -LRB- but does not actually take place -RRB-  under the applied force, if friction were absent.  "
"We know from experience that as the applied force exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to move.  "
"Kinetic friction, like static friction, is found to be independent of the area of contact.  "
"The laws of friction given above do not have the status of fundamental laws like those for gravitational, electric and magnetic forces.  "
They are empirical relations that are only approximately true.  
Yet they are very useful in practical calculations in mechanics.  
"Thus, when two bodies are in contact, each experiences a contact force by the other.  "
"Friction, by definition, is the component of the contact force parallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes impending or actual relative motion between the two surfaces.  "
"Note that it is not motion, but relative motion that the frictional force opposes.  "
Consider a box lying in the compartment of a train that is accelerating.  
"If the box is stationary relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along with the train.  "
What forces cause the acceleration of the box?  
"Clearly, the only conceivable force in the horizontal direction is the force of friction.  "
"If there were no friction, the floor of the train would slip by and the box would remain at its initial position due to inertia  -LRB- and hit the back side of the train -RRB- .  "
"Static friction provides the same acceleration to the box as that of the train, keeping it stationary relative to the train.  "
"At every instant, there is just one point of contact between the body and the plane and this point has no motion relative to the plane.  "
"In this ideal situation, kinetic or static friction is zero and the body should continue to roll with constant velocity.  "
"For the same weight, rolling friction is much smaller  -LRB- even by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude -RRB-  than static or sliding friction.  "
This is the reason why discovery of the wheel has been a major milestone in human history.  
"Rolling friction again has a complex origin, though somewhat different from that of static and sliding friction.  "
"During rolling, the surfaces in contact get momentarily deformed a little, and this results in a finite area  -LRB- not a point -RRB-  of the body being in contact with the surface.  "
We are able to walk because of friction.  
It is impossible for a car to move on a very slippery road.  
"On an ordinary road, the friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary external force to accelerate the car.  "
This force directed forwards the center is called the centripetal force.  
"For a stone rotated in a circle by a string, the centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string.  "
The centripetal force for motion of a planet around the sun is the gravitational force on the planet due to the sun.  
"For a car taking a circular turn on a horizontal road, the centripetal force is the force of friction.  "
The circular motion of a car on a flat and banked road give interesting application of the laws of motion.  
Three forces act on the car.  
Note that it is the static friction that provides the centripetal acceleration.  
Static friction opposes the impending motion of the car moving away from the circle.  
"Since there is no acceleration along the vertical direction, the net force along this direction must be zero.  "
Driving at this speed on a banked road will cause little wear and tear of the tyres.  
"On an unbanked road, frictional force alone can provide the centripetal force needed to keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn without slipping.  "
"On a banked road, the horizontal component of the normal force and the frictional force contribute to provide centripetal force to keep the car moving on a circular turn without slipping.  "
"At the optimum speed, the normal reaction's component is enough to provide the needed centripetal force, and the frictional force is not needed.  "
The three laws of motion that you have learnt in this chapter are the foundation of mechanics.  
You should now be able to handle a large variety of problems in mechanics.  
A typical problem in mechanics usually does not merely involve a single body under the action of given forces.  
"More often, we will need to consider an assembly of different bodies exerting forces on each other.  "
"Besides, each body in the assembly experiences the force of gravity.  "
We may call the chosen part of the assembly as the system and the remaining part of the assembly  -LRB- plus any other agencies of forces -RRB-  as the environment.  
We have followed the same method in solved examples.  
"To handle a typical problem in mechanics systematically, one should use the following steps.  "
" -LRB- i -RRB-  Draw a diagram showing schematically the various parts of the assembly of bodies, the links, supports, etc.   "
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Choose a convenient part of the assembly as one system.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  Draw a separate diagram which shows this system and all the forces on the system by the remaining part of the assembly.  
Include also the forces on the system by other agencies.  
Do not include the forces on the environment by the system.  
A diagram of this type is known as ' a free-body diagram '.  
Note this does not imply that the system under consideration is without a net force.  
The rest should be treated as unknowns to be determined using laws of motion.  
The force of gravity on the mass in  -LRB- a -RRB-  or  -LRB- b -RRB-  and the normal force on the mass by the floor are not action - reaction pairs.  
These forces happen to be equal and opposite for  -LRB- a -RRB-  since the mass is at rest.  
"They are not so for case  -LRB- b -RRB- , as seen already.  "
The practice of drawing free-body diagrams is of great help in solving problems in mechanics.  
It allows you to clearly define your system and consider all forces on the system due to objects that are not part of the system itself.  
A number of exercises in this and subsequent chapters will help you cultivate this practice.  
"The terms ' work ', ' energy ' and ' power ' are frequently used in everyday language.  "
Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a day is said to have a large stamina or energy.  
We admire a long distance runner for her stamina or energy.  
Energy is thus our capacity to do work.  
"In Physics too, the term ' energy ' is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term ' work ' itself is defined much more precisely.  "
The word ' power ' is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning.  
In karate or boxing we talk of ' powerful ' punches ; These are delivered at a great speed.  
This shade of meaning is close to the meaning of the word ' power ' used in physics.  
We shall find that there is at best a loose correlation between the physical definitions and the physiological pictures these terms generate in our minds.  
"The aim of this chapter is to develop an understanding of these three physical quantities ; Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two vectors.  "
We have learned about vectors and their use in Chapter 4.  
"Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force etc. are vectors.  "
We have also learned how vectors are added or subtracted.  
We now need to know how vectors are multiplied.  
We shall look at the vector product in Chapter 7.  
Here we take up the scalar product of two vectors.  
"Each vector, A and B, has a direction but their scalar product does not have a direction.  "
"Geometrically, B cos θ is the projection of B onto A in Fig.6.1 -LRB- b -RRB-  and A cos θ is the projection of A onto B in Fig. 6.1 -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
"So, A.B is the product of the magnitude of A and the component of B along A.  "
"Alternatively, it is the product of the magnitude of B and the component of A along B.  "
The proofs of the above equations are left to you as an exercise.  
"The following relation for rectilinear motion under constant acceleration a has been encountered in Chapter 3,  "
where u and v are the initial and final speeds and s the distance traversed.  
"Multiplying both sides by m/2, we have where the last step follows from Newton's Second Law.  "
We can generalise Eq. -LRB- 6.1 -RRB-  to three dimensions by employing vectors.  
The above equation provides a motivation for the definitions of work and kinetic energy.  
"We call each of these quantities the ' kinetic energy ', denoted by K.  "
The right side is a product of the displacement and the component of the force along the displacement.  
Work refers to the force and the displacement over which it acts  
Work is done by a force on the body over a certain displacement.  
where we have assumed that the drop is initially at rest.  
"As seen earlier, work is related to force and the displacement over which it acts.  "
Consider a constant force F acting on an object of mass m.  
The object undergoes a displacement d in the positive x-direction as shown in Fig. 6.2.  
The work done by the force is defined to be the product of component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement.  
"We see that if there is no displacement, there is no work done even if the force is large.  "
"Thus, when you push hard against a rigid brick wall, the force you exert on the wall does no work.  "
Yet your muscles are alternatively contracting and relaxing and internal energy is being used up and you do get tired.  
"Thus, the meaning of work in physics is different from its usage in everyday language.  "
 -LRB- i -RRB-  the displacement is zero as seen in the example above.  
A weightlifter holding a 150 kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s does no work on the load during this time.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  the force is zero.  
"A block moving on a smooth horizontal table is not acted upon by a horizontal force  -LRB- since there is no friction -RRB- , but may undergo a large displacement.  "
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  the force and displacement are mutually perpendicular.  
"For the block moving on a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational force mg does no work since it acts at right angles to the displacement.  "
If we assume that the moon's orbits around the earth is perfectly circular then the earth's gravitational force does no work.  
The moon's instantaneous displacement is tangential while the earth's force is radially inwards and θ = π/2.  
Work can be both positive and negative.  
"The SI unit of these is joule  -LRB- J -RRB- , named after the famous British physicist James Prescott Joule  -LRB- 1811-1869 -RRB- .  "
"Since work and energy are so widely used as physical concepts, alternative units abound and some of these are listed in Table 6.1.  "
Work done on the cycle by the road is the work done by the stopping  -LRB- frictional -RRB-  force on the cycle due to the road.  
It is this negative work that brings the cycle to a halt in accordance with WE theorem.  
 -LRB- b -RRB-  From Newton's Third Law an equal and opposite force acts on the road due to the cycle.  
Its magnitude is 200 N.  
"However, the road undergoes no displacement.  "
"Thus, work done by cycle on the road is zero.  "
Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.  
The kinetic energy of an object is a measure of the work an object can do by the virtue of its motion.  
This notion has been intuitively known for a long time.  
The kinetic energy of a fast flowing stream has been used to grind corn.  
Sailing ships employ the kinetic energy of the wind.  
Table 6.2 lists the kinetic energies for various objects.  
The speed is reduced by approximately 68%  -LRB- not 90% -RRB- .  
A constant force is rare.  
"It is the variable force, which is more commonly encountered.  "
Fig. 6.2 is a plot of a varying force in one dimension.  
"If the displacement Δx is small, we can take the force F -LRB- x -RRB-  as approximately constant and the work done is then ΔW = F -LRB- x -RRB-  Δx.  "
This is illustrated in Fig. 6.3 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
where ' lim ' stands for the limit of the sum when Δx tends to zero.  
"Thus, for a varying force the work done can be expressed as a definite integral of force over displacement  -LRB- see also Appendix 3.1 -RRB- .  "
The plot of the applied force is shown in Fig. 6.4.  
"At x = 20 m, F = 50 N  -LRB- ≠ 0 -RRB- .  "
We are given that the frictional force f is -PIPE-f-PIPE- = 50 N.  
It opposes motion and acts in a direction opposite to F.  
"It is therefore, shown on the negative side of the force axis.  "
The area on the negative side of the force axis has a negative sign.  
We are now familiar with the concepts of work and kinetic energy to prove the work-energy theorem for a variable force.  
We confine ourselves to one dimension.  
"Thus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable force.  "
"While the WE theorem is useful in a variety of problems, it does not, in general, incorporate the complete dynamical information of Newton's Second Law.  "
It is an integral form of Newton's second law.  
Newton's second law is a relation between acceleration and force at any instant of time.  
Work-energy theorem involves an integral over an interval of time.  
"In this sense, the temporal  -LRB- time -RRB-  information contained in the statement of Newton's second law is ' integrated over ' and is not available explicitly.  "
Another observation is that Newton's second law for two or three dimensions is in vector form whereas the work-energy theorem is in scalar form.  
"In the scalar form, information with respect to directions contained in Newton's second law is not present.  "
The word potential suggests possibility or capacity for action.  
The term potential energy brings to one's mind ' stored ' energy.  
A stretched bow-string possesses potential energy.  
"When it is released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.  "
They possess a large amount of potential energy.  
An earthquake results when these fault lines readjust.  
"Thus, potential energy is the ' stored energy ' by virtue of the position or configuration of a body.  "
The body left to itself releases this stored energy in the form of kinetic energy.  
Let us make our notion of potential energy more concrete.  
The gravitational force on a ball of mass m is surface.  
g may be treated as a constant near the earth surface.  
The work done by the external agency against the gravitational force is mgh.  
This work gets stored as potential energy.  
The negative sign indicates that the gravitational force is downward.  
"When released, the ball comes down with an increasing speed.  "
"Just before it hits the ground, its speed is given by the kinematic relation,  "
"which shows that the gravitational potential energy of the object at height h, when the object is released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of the object on reaching the ground.  "
The work done by a conservative force such as gravity depends on the initial and final positions only.  
In the previous chapter we have worked on examples dealing with inclined planes.  
"Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it acquires a kinetic energy, mgh.  "
"If the work done or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors such as the velocity or the particular path taken by the object, the force would be called non - conservative.  "
In the example of the falling ball considered in this section we saw how potential energy was converted to kinetic energy.  
"This hints at an important principle of conservation in mechanics, which we now proceed to examine.  "
"Thus, the principle of conservation of total mechanical energy can be stated as The total mechanical energy of a system is conserved if the forces, doing work on it, are conservative.  "
The above discussion can be made more concrete by considering the example of the gravitational force once again and that of the spring force in the next section.  
Fig. 6.5 depicts a ball of mass m being dropped from a cliff of height H.  
The constant force is a special case of a spatially dependent force F  -LRB- x -RRB- .  
"Hence, the mechanical energy is conserved.  "
"At the height H, the energy is purely potential.  "
It is partially converted to kinetic at height h and is fully kinetic at ground level.  
This illustrates the conservation of mechanical energy.  
 -LRB- i -RRB-  There are two external forces on the bob: gravity and the tension  -LRB- T -RRB-  in the string.  
The latter does no work since the displacement of the bob is always normal to the string.  
The potential energy of the bob is thus associated with the gravitational force only.  
The total mechanical energy E of the system is conserved.  
We take the potential energy of the system to be zero at the lowest point A.  
"At point C, the string becomes slack and the velocity of the bob is horizontal and to the left.  "
"If the connecting string is cut at this instant, the bob will execute a projectile motion with horizontal projection akin to a rock kicked horizontally from the edge of a cliff.  "
Otherwise the bob will continue on its circular path and complete the revolution.  
The spring force is an example of a variable force which is conservative.  
Fig. 6.7 shows a block attached to a spring and resting on a smooth horizontal surface.  
The other end of the spring is attached to a rigid wall.  
The spring is light and may be treated as massless.  
The displacement could be either positive  -LRB- Fig. 6.7b -RRB-  or negative  -LRB- Fig. 6.7c -RRB- .  
This force law for the spring is called Hooke's law and is mathematically stated as.  
The constant k is called the spring constant.  
The spring is said to be stiff if k is large and soft if k is small.  
Suppose that we pull the block outwards as in Fig. 6.7 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
This expression may also be obtained by considering the area of the triangle as in Fig. 6.7 -LRB- d -RRB- .  
Note that the work done by the external pulling force F is positive since it overcomes the spring force.  
The spring force does work while the external force F does work.  
Thus the work done by the spring force depends only on the end points.  
The work done by the spring force in a cyclic process is zero.  
"We have explicitly demonstrated that the spring force  -LRB- i -RRB-  is position dependent only as first stated by Hooke,  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  does work which only depends on the initial and final positions, e.g. Eq.  -LRB- 6.17 -RRB- .  "
"Thus, the spring force is a conservative force.  "
We define the potential energy V  -LRB- x -RRB-  of the spring to be zero when block and spring system is in the equilibrium position.  
"You may easily verify that −dV/dx=− kx, the spring force.  "
"The kinetic energy gets converted to potential energy and vice versa, however, the total mechanical energy remains constant.  "
This is graphically depicted in Fig. 6.8.  
At maximum compression the kinetic energy of the car is converted entirely into the potential energy of the spring.  
We note that we have idealised the situation.  
The spring is considered to be massless ; The surface has been considered to possess negligible friction.  
We conclude this section by making a few remarks on conservative forces.  
 -LRB- i -RRB-  Information on time is absent from the above discussions.  
"In the example considered above, we can calculate the compression, but not the time over which the compression occurs.  "
A solution of Newton's Second Law for this system is required for temporal information.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Not all forces are conservative.  
"Friction, for example, is a non-conservative force.  "
The principle of conservation of energy will have to be modified in this case.  
This is illustrated in Example 6.9.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.  
It is set according to convenience.  
"For the spring force we took V -LRB- x -RRB- =0, at x = 0, i.e. the unstretched spring had zero potential energy.  "
"In a later chapter we shall see that for the force due to the universal law of gravitation, the zero is best defined at an infinite distance from the gravitational source.  "
"In presence of friction, both the spring force and the frictional force act so as to oppose the compression of the spring as shown in Fig. 6.9.  "
"We invoke the work-energy theorem, rather than the conservation of mechanical energy.  "
"which, as expected, is less than the result in Example 6.8.  "
"one based on motion, namely kinetic energy; the other on configuration  -LRB- position -RRB- , namely potential energy.  "
Energy comes in many a forms which transform into one another in ways which may not often be clear to us.  
We have seen that the frictional force is excluded from the category of conservative forces.  
"However, work is associated with the force of friction.  "
"If we confine our scope to mechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy of the block is ' lost ' due to the frictional force.  "
On examination of the block and the table we would detect a slight increase in their temperatures.  
"The work done by friction is not ' lost ', but is transferred as heat energy.   "
This raises the internal energy of the block and the table.  
"If the total energy of the reactants is more than the products of the reaction, heat is released and the reaction is said to be an exothermic reaction.  "
"If the reverse is true, heat is absorbed and the reaction is endothermic.  "
Chemical energy is associated with the forces that give rise to the stability of substances.  
"These forces bind atoms into molecules, molecules into polymeric chains, etc..  "
"The chemical energy arising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas, wood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily existence.  "
"The flow of electrical current causes bulbs to glow, fans to rotate and bells to ring.  "
"There are laws governing the attraction and repulsion of charges and currents, which we shall learn later.  "
Energy is associated with an electric current.  
An urban Indian household consumes about 200 J of energy per second on an average.  
"Till the end of the nineteenth century, physicists believed that in every physical and chemical process, the mass of an isolated system is conserved.  "
"Matter might change its phase, e.g. glacial ice could melt into a gushing stream, but matter is neither created nor destroyed;  "
"Albert Einstein  -LRB- 1879-1955 -RRB-  however, showed that mass and energy are equivalent and are related by the relation.  "
This is equivalent to the annual electrical output of a large  -LRB- 3000 MW -RRB-  power generating station.  
"The most destructive weapons made by man, the fission and fusion bombs are manifestations of the above equivalence of mass and energy  -LSB- Eq.  -LRB- 6.20 -RRB-  -RSB- .  "
On the other hand the explanation of the life-nourishing energy output of the sun is also based on the above equation.  
In this case effectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus whose mass is less than the sum of the masses of the reactants.  
"However,for a chemical reaction, this mass defect is much smaller than for a nuclear reaction.  "
Table 6.3 lists the total energies for a variety of events and phenomena.  
We point out a common misconception created by newspapers and magazines.  
They mention food values in calories and urge us to restrict diet intake to below 2400 calories.  
What they should be saying is kilocalories  -LRB- kcal -RRB-  and not calories.  
A person consuming 2400 calories a day will soon starve to death ; food calorie is 1 kcal.  
We have seen that the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved if the forces doing work on it are conservative.  
"If some of the forces involved are non-conservative, part of the mechanical energy may get transformed into other forms such as heat, light and sound.  "
"However, the total energy of an isolated system does not change, as long as one accounts for all forms of energy.  "
Energy may be transformed from one form to another but the total energy of an isolated system remains constant.  
"Energy can neither be created, nor destroyed.  "
"Since the universe as a whole may be viewed as an isolated system, the total energy of the universe is constant.  "
"If one part of the universe loses energy, another part must gain an equal amount of energy.  "
The principle of conservation of energy can not be proved.  
"However, no violation of this principle has been observed.  "
"The concept of conservation and transformation of energy into various forms links together various branches of physics, chemistry and life sciences.  "
"It provides a unifying, enduring element in our scientific pursuits.  "
"From engineering point of view all electronic, communication and mechanical devices rely on some forms of energy transformation.  "
"Often it is interesting to know not only the work done on an object, but also the rate at which this work is done.  "
We say a person is physically fit if he not only climbs four floors of a building but climbs them fast.  
Power is defined as the time rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.  
"The instantaneous power is defined as the limiting value of the average power as time interval approaches zero,  "
where v is the instantaneous velocity when the force is F.  
"Power, like work and energy, is a scalar quantity.  "
"The unit of power is named after James Watt, one of the innovators of the steam engine in the eighteenth century.  "
"This unit is still used to describe the output of automobiles, motorbikes, etc.  "
"We encounter the unit watt when we buy electrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and refrigerators.  "
A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10 hours uses 1 kilowatt hour  -LRB- kWh -RRB-  of energy.  
Our electricity bills carry the energy consumption in units of kWh.  
Note that kWh is a unit of energy and not of power.  
The motor must supply enough power to balance this force.  
In physics we study motion  -LRB- change in position -RRB- .  
"At the same time, we try to discover physical quantities, which do not change in a physical process.  "
The laws of momentum and energy conservation are typical examples.  
"In this section we shall apply these laws to a commonly encountered phenomena, namely collisions.  "
"Several games such as billiards, marbles or carrom involve collisions.  "
We shall study the collision of two masses in an idealised form.  
"We shall see that there are relationships, which connect the masses, the velocities and the angles.  "
In all collisions the total linear momentum is conserved; the initial momentum of the system is equal to the final momentum of the system.  
One can argue this as follows.  
"When two objects collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over the collision time Δt cause a change in their respective momenta.  "
F is likewise the force exerted on the second particle by the first particle.  
The above conclusion is true even though the forces vary in a complex fashion during the collision time Δt.  
"Since the third law is true at every instant, the total impulse on the first object is equal and opposite to that on the second.  "
"On the other hand, the total kinetic energy of the system is not necessarily conserved.  "
The impact and deformation during collision may generate heat and sound.  
Part of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy.  
Such a collision is called an elastic collision.  
The intermediate case where the deformation is partly relieved and some of the initial kinetic energy is lost is more common and is appropriately called an inelastic collision.  
Consider first a completely inelastic collision in one dimension.  
"In practice, however, this number is smaller since head-on collisions are rare.  "
"If the initial velocities and final velocities of both the bodies are along the same straight line, then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or head-on collision.  "
"In the case of small spherical bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel of body 1 passes through the center of body 2 which is at rest.  "
"In general, the collision is two - dimensional, where the initial velocities and the final velocities lie in a plane.  "
Linear momentum is conserved in such a collision.  
"Since momentum is a vector this implies three equations for the three directions {x, y, z}.  "
The conservation of the z-component of the linear momentum implies that the entire collision is in the x-y plane.  
"This proves the following result: when two equal masses undergo a glancing elastic collision with one of them at rest, after the collision, they will move at right angles to each other.  "
"The matter simplifies greatly if we consider spherical masses with smooth surfaces, and assume that collision takes place only when the bodies touch each other.  "
"This is what happens in the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.  "
"In our everyday world, collisions take place only when two bodies touch each other.  "
"But consider a comet coming from far distances to the sun, or alpha particle coming towards a nucleus and going away in some direction.  "
Here we have to deal with forces involving action at a distance.  
We shall discuss the motion of the center of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding the motion of extended bodies.  
A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  
Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape.  
The distances between different pairs of such a body do not change.  
"It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the influence of forces.  "
But in many situations the deformations are negligible.  
Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples of the motion of rigid bodies.  
Let us begin with a rectangular block sliding down an inclined plane without any sidewise movement.  
The block is a rigid body.  
"Its motion down the plane is such that all the particles of the body are moving together, i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant of time.  "
The rigid body here is in pure translational motion.  
In pure translational motion at any instant of time every particle of the body has the same velocity.  
Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane  -LRB- Fig. 7.2 -RRB- .  
"The rigid body in this problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus, has translational motion.  "
"But as Fig. 7.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with the same velocity at any instant.  "
"The body therefore, is not in pure translation.  "
Its motion is translation plus 'something else'.  
"In order to understand what this 'something else' is, let us take a rigid body so constrained that it can not have translational motion.  "
The most common way to constrain a rigid body so that it does not have translational motion is to fix it along a straight line.  
The only possible motion of such a rigid body is rotation.  
The line along which the body is fixed is termed as its axis of rotation.  
"Let us try to understand what rotation is, what characterises rotation.  "
Fig. 7.4 shows the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis  -LRB- the z-axis of the frame of reference -RRB- .  
The circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis.  
"This circle, too, lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis.  "
Any such particle remains stationary while the body rotates.  
This is expected since the axis is fixed.  
"In some examples of rotation, however, the axis may not be fixed.  "
A prominent example of this kind of rotation is a top spinning in place  -LRB- Fig. 7.5  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  
We assume that the top does not slip from place to place and so does not have translational motion.  
This movement of the axis of the top around the vertical is termed precession.  
"Note, the point of contact of the top with ground is fixed.  "
The axis of rotation of the top at any instant passes through the point of contact.  
Another simple example of this kind of rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal fan.  
"While the fan rotates and its axis moves sidewise, this point is fixed.  "
"Thus, in more general cases of rotation, such as the rotation of a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not one line, of the rigid body is fixed.  "
"In this case the axis is not fixed, though it always passes through the fixed point.  "
"In our study, however, we mostly deal with the simpler and special case of rotation in which one line  -LRB- i.e. the axis -RRB-  is fixed.  "
"Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis only unless stated otherwise.  "
The rolling motion of a cylinder down an inclined plane is a combination of rotation about a fixed axis and translation.  
"Thus, the 'something else' in the case of rolling motion which we referred to earlier is rotational motion.  "
You will find Fig. 7.6 -LRB- a -RRB-  and  -LRB- b -RRB-  instructive from this point of view.  
Both these figures show motion of the same body along identical translational trajectory.  
"In one case, Fig. 7.6 -LRB- a -RRB- , the motion is a pure translation; in the other case Fig. 7.6 -LRB- b -RRB-  it is a combination of translation and rotation.  "
You may try to reproduce the two types of motion shown using a rigid object like a heavy book.  
We now recapitulate the most important observations of the present section.  
The motion of a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in some way is either a pure translation or a combination of translation and rotation.  
The motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed in some way is rotation.  
"We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only.  "
We shall first see what the center of mass of a system of particles is and then discuss its significance.  
For simplicity we shall start with a two particle system.  
We shall take the line joining the two particles to be the x-axis.  
"Thus, for two particles of equal mass the center of mass lies exactly midway between them.  "
"The symbol ∑  -LRB- the Greek letter sigma -RRB-  denotes summation, in this case over n particles.  "
The sum is the total mass of the system.  
"Suppose that we have three particles, not lying in a straight line.  "
"The center of mass C of the system of the three particles is defined and located by the coordinates  -LRB- X,Y -RRB-  given by.  "
"Thus, for three particles of equal mass, the center of mass coincides with the centroid of the triangle formed by the particles.  "
"Results of Eqs.  -LRB- 7.3a -RRB-  and  -LRB- 7.3b -RRB-  are generalised easily to a system of n particles, not necessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in space.  "
"The center of mass of such a system is at  -LRB- X, Y, Z -RRB- ,  "
"Eqs.  -LRB- 7.4a -RRB- ,  -LRB- 7.4b -RRB-  and  -LRB- 7.4c -RRB-  can be combined into one equation using the notation of position vectors.  "
The sum on the right hand side is a vector sum.  
Note the economy of expressions we achieve by use of vectors.  
The number of particles  -LRB- atoms or molecules -RRB-  in such a body is so large that it is impossible to carry out the summations over individual particles in these equations.  
"Since the spacing of the particles is small, we can treat the body as a continuous distribution of mass.  "
"In that case, we denote the sums over i by integrals.  "
Here M is the total mass of the body.  
The coordinates of the center of mass now are.  
The vector expression equivalent to these three scalar expressions is.  
"If we choose, the center of mass as the origin of our coordinate system.  "
"Often we have to calculate the center of mass of homogeneous bodies of regular shapes like rings, discs, spheres, rods etc.  "
By a homogeneous body we mean a body with uniformly distributed mass.  
"By using symmetry consideration, we can easily show that the centres of mass of these bodies lie at their geometric centres.  "
The net contribution of every such pair to the integral and hence the integral ∫xdm itself is zero.  
"From Eq. -LRB- 7.6 -RRB- , the point for which the integral itself is zero, is the center of mass.  "
"Thus, the center of mass of a homogenous thin rod coincides with its geometric center.  "
This can be understood on the basis of reflection symmetry.  
"The same symmetry argument will apply to homogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even thick rods of circular or rectangular cross section.  "
"For all such bodies you will realize that for every element dm at a point  -LRB- x, y, z -RRB-  one can always take an element of the same mass at the point  -LRB- -x,-y,-z -RRB- .  "
"Similarly, we can argue that it lies on the median MQ and NR.  "
"This means the center of mass lies on the point of concurrence of the medians, i.e. on the centroid G of the triangle.  "
Choosing the X and Y axes as shown in Fig. 7.11 we have the coordinates of the vertices of the L-shaped lamina as given in the figure.  
We can think of the L-shape to consist of 3 squares each of length 1m.  
"The mass of each square is 1kg, since the lamina is uniform.  "
The center of mass of the L-shape lies on the line OD.  
We could have guessed this without calculations.  
Can you tell why?  
"Suppose, the three squares that make up the L shaped lamina of Fig. 7.11 had different masses ; How will you then determine the center of mass of the lamina?  "
"Equipped with the definition of the center of mass, we are now in a position to discuss its physical importance for a system of particles.  "
"We have therefore, treated them as constants in differentiating the equations with respect to time.  "
"Thus, the total mass of a system of particles times the acceleration of its center of mass is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the system of particles.  "
Among these forces on each particle there will be external forces exerted by bodies outside the system and also internal forces exerted by the particles on one another.  
Only the external forces contribute to the equation.  
To obtain Eq.  -LRB- 7.11 -RRB-  we did not need to specify the nature of the system of particles.  
"The system may be a collection of particles in which there may be all kinds of internal motions, or it may be a rigid body which has either pure translational motion or a combination of translational and rotational motion.  "
"Whatever is the system and the motion of its individual particles, the center of mass moves according to Eq.  -LRB- 7.11 -RRB- .  "
"Instead of treating extended bodies as single particles as we have done in earlier chapters, we can now treat them as systems of particles.  "
This is the procedure that we followed earlier in analyzing forces on bodies and solving problems without explicitly outlining and justifying the procedure.  
We no longer need to do this.  
Figure 7.12 is a good illustration of Eq.  -LRB- 7.11 -RRB- .  
"A projectile, following the usual parabolic trajectory, explodes into fragments midway in air.  "
The forces leading to the explosion are internal forces.  
They contribute nothing to the motion of the center of mass.  
"The total external force, namely, the force of gravity acting on the body, is the same before and after the explosion.  "
"The center of mass under the influence of the external force continues, therefore, along the same parabolic trajectory as it would have followed if there were no explosion.  "
Let us recall that the linear momentum of a particle is defined as.  
Let us also recall that Newton's second law written in symbolic form for a single particle is.  
where F is the force on the particle.  
The particles may be interacting and have external forces acting on them.  
"For the system of n particles, the linear momentum of the system is defined to be the vector sum of all individual particles of the system.  "
"Thus, the total momentum of a system of particles is equal to the product of the total mass of the system and the velocity of its center of mass.  "
This is the statement of Newton's second law extended to a system of particles.  
"Suppose now, that the sum of external forces acting on a system of particles is zero.  "
"Thus, when the total external force acting on a system of particles is zero, the total linear momentum of the system is constant.  "
This is the law of conservation of the total linear momentum of a system of particles.  
"In many pr oblems on the system of particles as in the above radioactive decay problem, it is convenient to work in the center of mass frame rather than in the laboratory frame of reference.  "
"In astronomy, binary  -LRB- double -RRB-  stars is a common occurrence.  "
"If there are no external forces, the center of mass of a double star moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.7.14  -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
The trajectories of the two stars of equal mass are also shown in the figure; they look complicated.  
"If we go to the center of mass frame, then we find that there the two stars are moving in a circle, about the center of mass, which is at rest.  "
Note that the position of the stars have to be diametrically opposite to each other  -LRB- Fig. 7.14 -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  
We are already familiar with vectors and their use in physics.  
"In chapter 6  -LRB- Work, Energy, Power -RRB-  we defined the scalar product of two vectors.  "
"An important physical quantity, work, is defined as a scalar product of two vector quantities, force and displacement.  "
We shall now define another product of two vectors.  
This product is a vector.  
"Two important quantities in the study of rotational motion, namely, moment of a force and angular momentum, are defined as vector products.  "
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  c is perpendicular to the plane containing a and b.  
This right handed screw rule is illustrated in Fig. 7.15a.  
Open up your right hand palm and curl the fingers pointing from a to b.  
Your stretched thumb points in the direction of c.  
It should be remembered that there are two angles between any two vectors a and b.  
In Fig. 7.15  -LRB- a -RRB-  or  -LRB- b -RRB-  they correspond to θ  -LRB- as shown -RRB-  and  -LRB- 360°– θ -RRB- .  
"While applying either of the above rules, the rotation should be taken through the smaller angle  -LRB-  _LESS_LT; 180° -RRB-  between a and b.  "
It is θ here.  
"Because of the cross used to denote the vector product, it is also referred to as cross product.  "
"Note that scalar product of two vectors is commutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a.  "
"The vector product, however, is not commutative, i.e. a×b ≠ b×a.  "
"The magnitude of both a×b and b×a is the same  -LRB- ab sin θ -RRB- ; also, both of them are perpendicular to the plane of a and b.  "
"But the rotation of the right-handed screw in case of a×b is from a to b, whereas in case of b×a it is from b to a.  "
This means the two vectors are in opposite directions.  
Another interesting property of a vector product is its behavior under reflection.  
"Under reflection  -LRB- i.e. on taking the mirror image -RRB-  we have x → −x , y → −y and z → −z.  "
"As a result all the components of a vector change sign and thus a → −a , b → −b.  "
What happens to a×b under reflection?  
"Thus, a×b does not change sign under reflection.  "
Both scalar and vector products are distributive with respect to vector addition.  
We may write c = a×b in the component form.  
The particle describes a circle with a center C on the axis.  
"The radius of the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of the point P from the axis.  "
We also show the linear velocity vector v of the particle at P.  
It is along the tangent at P to the circle.  
Let P′ be the position of the particle after an interval of time Δt  -LRB- Fig. 7.16 -RRB- .  
The angle PCP′ describes the angular displacement Δθ of the particle in time Δ t.  
The average angular velocity of the particle over the interval Δt is Δθ/Δt.  
"As Δt tends to zero  -LRB- i.e. takes smaller and smaller values -RRB- , the ratio Δθ/Δt approaches a limit which is the instantaneous angular velocity dθ/dt of the particle at the position P.  "
We denote the instantaneous angular velocity by ω  -LRB- the Greek letter omega -RRB- .  
We observe that at any given instant the relation υ = ω r applies to all particles of the rigid body.  
"The index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the total number of particles of the body.  "
"For particles on the axis,r=0, and hence v=ωr=0.  "
"Thus, particles on the axis are stationary.  "
This verifies that the axis is fixed.  
Note that we use the same angular velocity ω for all the particles.  
"We therefore, refer to ω as the angular velocity of the whole body.  "
We have characterised pure translation of a body by all parts of the body having the same velocity at any instant of time.  
"Similarly, we may characterise pure rotation by all parts of the body having the same angular velocity at any instant of time.  "
In our discussion so far the angular velocity appears to be a scalar.  
"In fact, it is a vector.  "
"We shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept it.  "
"It is not the force alone, but how and where the force is applied is important in rotational motion.  "
The rotational analog of force is moment of force.  
It is also referred to as torque.  
We shall use the words moment of force and torque interchangeably.  
We shall first define the moment of force for the special case of a single particle.  
Later on we shall extend the concept to systems of particles including rigid bodies.  
"We shall also relate it to a change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is angular acceleration of a rigid body.  "
The moment of force  -LRB- or torque -RRB-  is a vector quantity.  
The symbol τ stands for the Greek letter tau.  
The magnitude of τ is τ = rFsinθ.  
"where r is the magnitude of the position vector r, i.e. the length OP, F is the magnitude of force F and θ is the angle between r and F as shown.  "
Its dimensions are the same as those of work or energy.  
"It is, however, a very different physical quantity than work.  "
"Moment of a force is a vector, while work is a scalar.  "
The SI unit of moment of force is Newton-metre  -LRB- Nm -RRB- .  
"Thus, the moment of a force vanishes if either the magnitude of the force is zero, or if the line of action of the force passes through the origin.  "
"One may note that since r × F is a vector product, properties of a vector product of two vectors apply to it.  "
"If the direction of F is reversed, the direction of the moment of force is reversed.  "
"If directions of both r and F are reversed, the direction of the moment of force remains the same.  "
"Just as the moment of a force is the rotational analog of force, the quantity angular momentum is the rotational analog of linear momentum.  "
We shall first define angular momentum for the special case of a single particle and look at its usefulness in the context of single particle motion.  
We shall then extend the definition of angular momentum to systems of particles including rigid bodies.  
"Like moment of a force, angular momentum is also a vector product.  "
It could also be referred to as moment of  -LRB- linear -RRB-  momentum.  
From this term one could guess how angular momentum is defined.  
Consider a particle of mass m and linear momentum p at a position r relative to the origin O.  
"The physical quantities, moment of a force and angular momentum, have an important relation between them.  "
It is the rotational analog of the relation between force and linear momentum.  
"For deriving the relation in the context of a single particle, we differentiate l = r × p with respect to time,  "
Applying the product rule for differentiation to the right hand side.  
"Thus, the time rate of change of the angular momentum of a particle is equal to the torque acting on it.  "
"This is the rotational analog of the equation F = dp/dt, which expresses Newton's second law for the translational motion of a single particle.  "
To get the total angular momentum of a system of particles about a given point we need to add vectorially the angular momenta of individual particles.  
"Thus, for a system of n particles.  "
"Example 7.7 gives a proof of this result in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces acting on a rigid body in translational equilibrium.  "
The generalisation of this result to n forces is left as an exercise.  
"Eq.  -LRB- 7.30a -RRB-  and Eq.  -LRB- 7.30b -RRB- , both, are vector equations.  "
They are equivalent to three scalar equations each.  
Eq.  -LRB- 7.31a -RRB-  and  -LRB- 7.31b -RRB-  give six independent conditions to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium of a rigid body.  
In a number of problems all the forces acting on the body are coplanar.  
Then we need only three conditions to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium.  
Two of these conditions correspond to translational equilibrium; the sum of the components of the forces along any two perpendicular axes in the plane must be zero.  
The third condition corresponds to rotational equilibrium.  
The sum of the components of the torques along any axis perpendicular to the plane of the forces must be zero.  
"The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body may be compared with those for a particle, which we considered in earlier chapters.  "
"Since consideration of rotational motion does not apply to a particle, only the conditions for translational equilibrium  -LRB- Eq. 7.30 a -RRB-  apply to a particle.  "
"Thus, for equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of all the forces on it must be zero.  "
"Since all these forces act on the single particle, they must be concurrent.  "
Equilibrium under concurrent forces was discussed in the earlier chapters.  
The net moment on the rod will be zero.  
"The system will be in rotational equilibrium, but it will not be in translational equilibrium; ∑F ≠ 0.  "
The force at B in Fig. 7.20 -LRB- a -RRB-  is reversed in Fig. 7.20 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
"Thus, we have the same rod with two equal and opposite forces applied perpendicular to the rod, one at end A and the other at end B.  "
"Here the moments of both the forces are equal, but they are not opposite; they act in the same sense and cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  "
The total force on the body is zero; so the body is in translational equilibrium; but it is not in r otational equilibrium.  
"Although the rod is not fixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation  -LRB- i.e. rotation without translation -RRB- .  "
A pair of equal and opposite forces with different lines of action is known as a couple.  
A couple produces rotation without translation.  
"When we open the lid of a bottle by turning it, our fingers are applying a couple to the lid  -LSB- Fig. 7.21 -LRB- a -RRB-  -RSB- .  "
Another known example is a compass needle in the earth's magnetic field as shown in the Fig. 7.21 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
The earth's magnetic field exerts equal forces on the north and south poles.  
"The force on the North Pole is towards the north, and the force on the South Pole is toward the south.  "
Except when the needle points in the north-south direction; the two forces do not have the same line of action.  
Thus there is a couple acting on the needle due to the earth's magnetic field.  
Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 7.22 acting on a rigid body.  
The forces F and - F act respectively at points B and A.  
Let us take the moments of the forces about the origin.  
"Clearly this is independent of the origin, the point about which we took the moments of the forces.  "
An ideal lever is essentially a light  -LRB- i.e. of negligible mass -RRB-  rod pivoted at a point along its length.  
This point is called the fulcrum.  
A see - saw on the children's playground is a typical example of a lever.  
The lever is a system in mechanical equilibrium.  
Let R be the reaction of the support at the fulcrum.  
Normally the anticlockwise  -LRB- clockwise -RRB-  moments are taken to be positive  -LRB- negative -RRB- .  
Note R acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment about the fulcrum.  
Mechanical advantage greater than one means that a small effort can be used to lift a large load.  
There are several examples of a lever around you besides the see-saw.  
The beam of a balance is a lever.  
"Try to find more such examples and identify the fulcrum, the effort and effort arm, and the load and the load arm of the lever in each case.  "
Many of you may have the experience of balancing your notebook on the tip of a finger.  
Figure 7.24 illustrates a similar experiment that you can easily perform.  
Take an irregular - shaped cardboard and a narrow tipped object like a pencil.  
You can locate by trial and error a point G on the cardboard where it can be balanced on the tip of the pencil.  
The cardboard remains horizontal in this position.  
This point of balance is the center of gravity  -LRB- CG -RRB-  of the cardboard.  
The tip of the pencil provides a vertically upward force due to which the cardboard is in mechanical equilibrium.  
"It is also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so, due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and fall.  "
"We may therefore, define the CG of a body as that point where the total gravitational torque on the body is zero.  "
"We notice that in Eq.  -LRB- 7.33 -RRB- , g is the same for all particles, and hence it comes out of the summation.  "
"Thus, the center of gravity of the body coincides with the center of mass.  "
"We note that this is true because the body being small, g does not vary from one point of the body to the other.  "
"If the body is so extended that g varies from part to part of the body, then the center of gravity and center of mass will not coincide.  "
"Basically, the two are different concepts.  "
The center of mass has nothing to do with gravity.  
It depends only on the distribution of mass of the body.  
"In sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the center of mass of several regular, homogeneous objects.  "
"Obviously the method used there gives us also the center of gravity of these bodies, if they are small enough.  "
Figure 7.25 illustrates another way of determining the CG of an regular shaped body like a cardboard.  
"If you suspend the body from some point like A, the vertical line through A passes through the CG.  "
We then suspend the body through other points like B and C.  
Explain why the method works.  
"Since the body is small enough, the method allows us to determine also its center of mass.  "
Note the weight of the rod W acts at its center of gravity G.  
The rod is uniform in cross section and homogeneous; hence G is at the center of the rod; AB = 70 cm.  
"For considering rotational equilibrium, we take moments of the forces.  "
A convenient point to take moments about is G.  
"The ladder AB is 3 m long, its foot A is at distance AC = 1 m from the wall.  "
Note that F prevents the ladder from sliding away from the wall and is therefore directed toward the wall.  
We have already mentioned that we are developing the study of rotational motion parallel to the study of translational motion with which we are familiar.  
We have yet to answer one major question in this connection ; What is the analog of mass in rotational motion?  
We shall attempt to answer this question in the present section.  
"To keep the discussion simple, we shall consider rotation about a fixed axis only.  "
Let us try to get an expression for the kinetic energy of a rotating body.  
"The total kinetic energy K of the body is then given by the sum of the kinetic energies of individual particles, Here n is the number of particles in the body.  "
Note ω is the same for all particles.  
Note that the parameter I is independent of the magnitude of the angular velocity.  
It is a characteristic of the rigid body and the axis about which it rotates.  
Here m is the mass of the body and v is its velocity.  
We have already noted the analogy between angular velocity ω  -LRB- in respect of rotational motion about a fixed axis -RRB-  and linear velocity v  -LRB- in respect of linear motion -RRB- .  
"It is then evident that the parameter, moment of inertia I, is the desired rotational analog of mass.  "
"In rotation  -LRB- about a fixed axis -RRB- , the moment of inertia plays a similar role as mass does in linear motion.  "
"We now apply the definition Eq.  -LRB- 7.34 -RRB- , to calculate the moment of inertia in two simple cases.  "
" -LRB- a -RRB-  Consider a thin ring of radius R and mass M, rotating in its own plane around its center with angular velocity ω.  "
"Each mass element of the ring is at a distance R from the axis, and moves with a speed R ω.  "
Each mass M/2 is at a distance l/2 from the axis.  
"Thus, for the pair of masses, rotating about the axis thr ough the center of mass perpendicular to the rod.  "
Table 7.1 gives the moment of inertia of various familiar regular shaped solids about specific axes.  
"As the mass of a body resists a change in its state of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia in linear motion.  "
"Unlike the mass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a fixed quantity but depends on the orientation and position of the axis of rotation with respect to the body as a whole.  "
"As a measure of the way in which the mass of a rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to the axis of rotation, we can define a new parameter, the radius of gyration.  "
It is related to the moment of inertia and the total mass of the body.  
"Similarly, k = R/2 for the circular disc about its diameter.  "
The length k is a geometric property of the body and axis of rotation.  
It is called the radius of gyration.  
"Thus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body depends on the mass of the body, its shape and size; distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the position and orientation of the axis of rotation.  "
The property of this extremely important quantity I as a measure of rotational inertia of the body has been put to a great practical use.  
"The machines, such as steam engine and the automobile engine, etc., that produce rotational motion have a disc with a large moment of inertia, called a flywheel.  "
"Because of its large moment of inertia, the flywheel resists the sudden increase or decrease of the speed of the vehicle.  "
"It allows a gradual change in the speed and prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring a smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.  "
These are two useful theorems relating to moment of inertia.  
We shall first discuss the theorem of perpendicular axes and its simple yet instructive application in working out the moments of inertia of some regular - shaped bodies.  
This theorem is applicable to bodies which are planar.  
"In practice this means the theorem applies to flat bodies whose thickness is very small compared to their other dimensions  -LRB- e.g. length, breadth or radius -RRB- .  "
Fig. 7.29 illustrates the theorem.  
The figure shows a planar body.  
An axis perpendicular to the body through a point O is taken as the z-axis.  
"Two mutually perpendicular axes lying in the plane of the body and concurrent with z-axis, i.e. passing through O, are taken as the x and y-axes.  "
Let us look at the usefulness of the theorem through an example.  
The disc can be considered to be a planar body.  
Hence the theorem of perpendicular axes is applicable to it.  
"As shown in Fig. 7.30, we take three concurrent axes through the center of the disc, O as the x, y, z axes; x and y-axes lie in the plane of the disc and z is perpendicular to it.  "
"Now, x and y axes are along two diameters of the disc, and by symmetry the moment of inertia of the disc is the same about any diameter.  "
Find similarly the moment of inertia of a ring about any of its diameter.  
Will the theorem be applicable to a solid cylinder?  
This theorem is applicable to a body of any shape.  
"It allows to find the moment of inertia of a body about any axis, given the moment of inertia of the body about a parallel axis through the center of mass of the body.  "
We shall only state this theorem and not give its proof.  
"We shall, however, apply it to a few simple situations which will be enough to convince us about the usefulness of the theorem.  "
"As shown in the Fig. 7.31, z and z′ are two parallel axes separated by a distance a.  "
The z-axis passes through the center of mass O of the rigid body.  
M is the total mass of the body and a is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel axes.  
The tangent to the ring in the plane of the ring is parallel to one of the diameters of the ring.  
We have already indicated the analogy between rotational motion and translational motion.  
"For example, the angular velocity ω plays the same role in rotation as the linear velocity v in translation.  "
We wish to take this analogy further.  
In doing so we shall restrict the discussion only to rotation about fixed axis.  
"This case of motion involves only one degree of freedom, i.e., needs only one independent variable to describe the motion.  "
This in translation corresponds to linear motion.  
This section is limited only to kinematics.  
We shall turn to dynamics in later sections.  
We recall that for specifying the angular displacement of the rotating body we take any particle like P  -LRB- Fig.7.33 -RRB-  of the body.  
"Note, as shown, the axis of rotation is the z — axis and the plane of the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.  "
"We also recall that the angular velocity is the time rate of change of angular displacement, ω = dθ/dt.  "
"Note since the axis of rotation is fixed, there is no need to treat angular velocity as a vector.  "
"Further, the angular acceleration, α = dω/dt.  "
The word ' initial ' refers to values of the quantities at t = 0.  
With the definition of ω = dθ/dt we may integrate Eq.  -LRB- 7.38 -RRB-  to get Eq.  -LRB- 7.39 -RRB- .  
This derivation and the derivation of Eq.  -LRB- 7.40 -RRB-  is left as an exercise.  
Table 7.2 lists quantities associated with linear motion and their analogs in rotational motion.  
We have already compared kinematics of the two motions.  
"Also, we know that in rotational motion moment of inertia and torque play the same role as mass and force respectively in linear motion.  "
Given this we should be able to guess what the other analogs indicated in the table are.  
"It is, however, necessary that these correspondences are established on sound dynamical considerations.  "
This is what we now turn to.  
"Before we begin, we note a simplification that arises in the case of rotational motion about a fixed axis.  "
"Since the axis is fixed, only those components of torques, which are along the direction of the fixed axis need to be considered in our discussion.  "
Only these components can cause the body to rotate about the axis.  
A component of the torque perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to turn the axis from its position.  
"We specifically assume that there will arise necessary forces of constraint to cancel the effect of the perpendicular components of the  -LRB- external -RRB-  torques, so that the fixed position of the axis will be maintained.  "
"The perpendicular components of the torques, therefore need not be taken into account.  "
This means that for our calculation of torques on a rigid body.  
We need to consider only those components of the position vectors which are perpendicular to the axis.  
Components of position vectors along the axis will result in torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account.  
As said above we need to consider only those forces which lie in planes perpendicular to the axis.  
For convenience we call this to be the x′ –y′ plane  -LRB- coincident with the plane of the page -RRB- .  
"If there are more than one forces acting on the body, the work done by all of them can be added to give the total work done on the body.  "
"Remember, the forces giving rise to the torques act on different particles, but the angular displacement dθ is the same for all particles.  "
This expression gives the work done by the total  -LRB- external -RRB-  torque τ which acts on the body rotating about a fixed axis.  
Its similarity with the corresponding expression dW = Fds for linear  -LRB- translational -RRB-  motion is obvious.  
This is the instantaneous power.  
"Compare this expression for power in the case of rotational motion about a fixed axis with the expression for power in the case of linear motion, P = Fv.  "
In a perfectly rigid body there is no internal motion.  
"The work done by external torques is therefore, not dissipated and goes on to increase the kinetic energy of the body.  "
The rate at which work is done on the body is given by Eq.  -LRB- 7.42 -RRB- .  
This is to be equated to the rate at which kinetic energy increases.  
We assume that the moment of inertia does not change with time.  
"This means that the mass of the body does not change, the body remains rigid and also the axis does not change its position with respect to the body.  "
Eq.  -LRB- 7.43 -RRB-  is similar to Newton's second law for linear motion expressed symbolically as F=ma.  
"Just as force produces acceleration, torque produces angular acceleration in a body.  "
The angular acceleration is directly proportional to the applied torque and is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia of the body.  
Eq.  -LRB- 7.43 -RRB-  can be called Newton's second law for rotation about a fixed axis.  
"The answers are the same, i.e. the kinetic energy gained by the wheel = work done by the force.  "
There is no loss of energy due to friction.  
"We have studied in section 7.7, the angular momentum of a system of particles.  "
"When the total external torque is zero, the total angular momentum of the system is conserved.  "
"The rigid bodies which we have mainly considered in this chapter are symmetric about the axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is one of their symmetry axes.  "
"As we have seen in the last section, only those components of the external torques which are along the axis of rotation, need to be taken into account, when we discuss rotation about a fixed axis.  "
"Thus, for rotation about a fixed axis, the component of angular momentum perpendicular to the fixed axis is constant.  "
We have already derived this equation using the work - kinetic energy route.  
We are now in a position to revisit the principle of conservation of angular momentum in the context of rotation about a fixed axis.  
"If friction in the rotational mechanism is neglected, there is no external torque about the axis of rotation of the chair and hence Iω is constant.  "
"Stretching the arms increases I about the axis of rotation, resulting in decreasing the angular speed  ω.  "
Bringing the arms closer to the body has the opposite effect.  
A circus acrobat and a diver take advantage of this principle.  
"Also, skaters and classical, Indian or western, dancers performing a pirouette on the toes of one foot display ' mastery ' over this principle.  "
One of the most common motions observed in daily life is the rolling motion.  
All wheels used in transportation have rolling motion.  
"For specificness we shall begin with the case of a disc, but the result will apply to any rolling body rolling on a level surface.  "
We shall assume that the disc rolls without slipping.  
This means that at any instant of time the bottom of the disc which is in contact with the surface is at rest on the surface.  
We have remarked earlier that rolling motion is a combination of rotation and translation.  
"The rotational motion of the disc is about its symmetry axis, which passes through C.  "
Our next task will be to obtain an expression for the kinetic energy of a rolling body.  
The kinetic energy of a rolling body can be separated into kinetic energy of translation and kinetic energy of rotation.  
"We assume this general result  -LRB- see Exercise 7.31 -RRB- , and apply it to the case of rolling motion.  "
"where I is the moment of inertia about the appropriate axis, which is the symmetry axis of the rolling body.  "
"Equation  -LRB- 7.49b -RRB-  applies to any rolling body: a disc, a cylinder, a ring or a sphere.  "
"We assume conservation of energy of the rolling body, i.e. there is no loss of energy due to friction etc.  "
"The potential energy lost by the body in rolling down the inclined plane  -LRB- = mgh -RRB-  must, therefore, be equal to kinetic energy gained.  "
Since the bodies start from rest the kinetic energy gained is equal to the final kinetic energy of the bodies.  
From the results obtained it is clear that among the three bodies the sphere has the greatest and the ring has the least velocity of the center of mass at the bottom of the inclined plane.  
Suppose the bodies have the same mass ; Which body has the greatest rotational kinetic energy while reaching the bottom of the inclined plane?  
"Early in our lives, we become aware of the tendency of all material objects to be attracted towards the earth.  "
"Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo  -LRB- 1564-1642 -RRB-  who recognized the fact that all bodies, irrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth with a constant acceleration.  "
It is said that he made a public demonstration of this fact.  
"A seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars, planets and their motion has been the subject of attention in many countries since the earliest of times.  "
Observations since early times recognized stars which appeared in the sky with positions unchanged year after year.  
The more interesting objects are the planets which seem to have regular motions against the background of stars.  
"The earliest recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy about 2000 years ago was a 'geocentric' model in which all celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved around the earth.  "
The only motion that was thought to be possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle.  
Complicated schemes of motion were put forward by Ptolemy in order to describe the observed motion of the planets.  
The planets were described as moving in circles with the center of the circles themselves moving in larger circles.  
Similar theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some 400 years later.  
"His theory was discredited by the church, but notable amongst its supporters was Galileo who had to face prosecution from the state for his beliefs.  "
"It was around the same time as Galileo, a nobleman called Tycho Brahe  -LRB- 1546-1601 -RRB-  hailing from Denmark, spent his entire lifetime recording observations of the planets with the naked eye.  "
His compiled data were analyzed later by his assistant Johannes Kepler  -LRB- 1571-1640 -RRB- .  
He could extract from the data three elegant laws that now go by the name of Kepler's laws.  
These laws were known to Newton and enabled him to make a great scientific leap in proposing his universal law of gravitation.  
1 Law of orbits: All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun situated at one of the foci of the ellipse  -LRB- Fig. 8.1a -RRB- .  
This law was a deviation from the Copernican model which allowed only circular orbits.  
"The ellipse, of which the circle is a special case, is a closed curve which can be drawn very simply as follows.  "
With the tip of a pencil stretch the string taut and then draw a curve by moving the pencil keeping the string taut throughout.  
The closed curve you get is called an ellipse.  
The midpoint of the line PA is the center of the ellipse O and the length PO = AO is called the semi - major axis of the ellipse.  
"For a circle, the two focii merge into one and the semi-major axis becomes the radius of the circle.  "
2 Law of areas: The line that joins any planet to the sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time.  
3 Law of periods: The square of the time period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced out by the planet.  
The table below gives the approximate time periods of revolution of nine planets around the sun along with values of their semi-major axes.  
Hence the planet will take a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB.  
"Legend has it that observing an apple falling from a tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an universal law of gravitation that led to an explanation of terrestrial gravitation as well as of Kepler's laws.  "
This clearly shows that the force due to earth's gravity decreases with distance.  
These observations led Newton to propose the following Universal Law of Gravitation.  
Every body in the universe attracts every other body with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  
The quotation is essentially from Newton's famous treatise called 'Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'  -LRB- Principia for short -RRB- .  
"If we have a collection of point masses, the force on any one of them is the vector sum of the gravitational forces exerted by the other point masses as shown in Fig 8.4.  "
 -LRB- a -RRB-  The angle between GC and the positive x-axis is 30° and so is the angle between GB and the negative x-axis.  
The individual forces in vector notation are.  
"Alternatively, one expects on the basis of symmetry that the resultant force ought to be zero.  "
 -LRB- b -RRB-  By symmetry the x-component of the force cancels out.  
The y-component survives.  
"For the gravitational force between an extended object  -LRB- like the earth -RRB-  and a point mass, Eq.  -LRB- 8.5 -RRB-  is not directly applicable.  "
Each point mass in the extended object will exert a force on the given point mass and these force will not all be in the same direction.  
We have to add up these forces vectorially for all the point masses in the extended object to get the total force.  
This is easily done using calculus.  
Qualitatively this can be understood as follows.  
Gravitational forces caused by the various regions of the shell have components along the line joining the point mass to the center as well as along a direction prependicular to this line.  
The magnitude of this force works out to be as stated above.  
" -LRB- 2 -RRB-  The force of attraction due to a hollow spherical shell of uniform density, on a point mass situated inside it is zero.  "
"Qualitatively, we can again understand this result.  "
Various regions of the spherical shell attract the point mass inside it in various directions.  
These forces cancel each other completely.  
The value of the gravitational constant G entering the Universal law of gravitation can be determined experimentally and this was first done by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.  
The bar AB has two small lead spheres attached at its ends.  
The bar is suspended from a rigid support by a fine wire.  
Two large lead spheres are brought close to the small ones but on opposite sides as shown.  
The big spheres attract the nearby small ones by equal and opposite force as shown.  
"Due to this torque, the suspended wire gets twisted till such time as the restoring torque of the wire equals the gravitational torque.  "
"If θ is the angle of twist of the suspended wire, the restoring torque is proportional to θ, equal to τθ.  "
Where τ is the restoring couple per unit angle of twist.  
τ can be measured independently e.g. by applying a known torque and measuring the angle of twist.  
The gravitational force between the spherical balls is the same as if their masses are concentrated at their centers.  
"If L is the length of the bar AB, then the torque arising out of F is F multiplied by L.  "
Observation of θ thus enables one to calculate G from this equation.  
"Since Cavendish's experiment, the measurement of G has been refined and the currently accepted value is.  "
The earth can be imagined to be a sphere made of a large number of concentric spherical shells with the smallest one at the center and the largest one at its surface.  
A point outside the earth is obviously outside all the shells.  
"Thus, all the shells exert a gravitational force at the point outside just as if their masses are concentrated at their common center according to the result stated in the last section.  "
The total mass of all the shells combined is just the mass of the earth.  
"Hence, at a point outside the earth, the gravitational force is just as if its entire mass of the earth is concentrated at its center.  "
"For a point inside the earth, the situation is different.  "
This is illustrated in Fig. 8.7.  
Again consider the earth to be made up of concentric shells as before and a point mass m situated at a distance r from the center.  
The point P lies outside the sphere of radius r.  
"For the shells of radius greater than r, the point P lies inside.  "
"Hence according to result stated in the last section, they exert no gravitational force on mass m kept at P.  "
The shells with radius ≤r make up a sphere of radius r for which the point P lies on the surface.  
"This is the reason why there is a popular statement regarding Cavendish:""Cavendish weighed the earth"".  "
Consider a point mass m at a height h above the surface of the earth as shown in Fig. 8.8 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
The force on m due to the outer shell of thickness d is zero because the result quoted in the previous section.  
Since mass of a sphere is proportional to be cube of its radius.  
The remarkable thing about acceleration due to earth's gravity is that it is maximum on its surface decreasing whether you go up or down.  
We had discussed earlier the notion of potential energy as being the energy stored in the body at its given position.  
"The force of gravity is a conservative force and we can calculate the potential energy of a body arising out of this force, called the gravitational potential energy.  "
"Consider points close to the surface of earth, at distances from the surface much smaller than the radius of the earth.  "
"In such cases, the force of gravity is practically a constant equal to mg, directed towards the center of the earth.  "
The work done in moving the particle is just the difference of potential energy between its final and initial positions.  
"If we consider points at arbitrary distance from the surface of the earth, the result just derived is not valid since the assumption that the gravitational force mg is a constant is no longer valid.  "
We have calculated the potential energy at a point of a particle due to gravitational forces on it due to the earth and it is proportional to the mass of the particle.  
The gravitational potential due to the gravitational force of the earth is defined as the potential energy of a particle of unit mass at that point.  
It should be noted that an isolated system of particles will have the total potential energy that equals the sum of energies  -LRB- given by the above equation -RRB-  for all possible pairs of its constituent particles.  
This is an example of the application of the superposition principle.  
"If a stone is thrown by hand, we see it falls back to the earth.  "
"Of course using machines we can shoot an object with much greater speeds and with greater and greater initial speed, the object scales higher and higher heights.  "
A natural query that arises in our mind is the following: can we throw an object with such high initial speeds that it does not fall back to the earth?  
The principle of conservation of energy helps us to answer this question.  
The energy of an object is the sum of potential and kinetic energy.  
"This is called the escape speed, sometimes loosely called the escape velocity.  "
"Both are smaller than their values on earth and the escape speed for the moon turns out to be 2.3 km/s, about five times smaller.  "
This is the reason that moon has no atmosphere.  
Gas molecules if formed on the surface of the moon having velocities larger than this will escape the gravitational pull of the moon.  
The projectile is acted upon by two mutually opposing gravitational forces of the two spheres.  
The neutral point N  -LRB- see Fig. 8.10 -RRB-  is defined as the position where the two forces cancel each other exactly.  
The neutral point r=-6R does not concern us in this example.  
Thus ON = r = 2 R.  
It is sufficient to project the particle with a speed which would enable it to reach N.  
"Thereafter, the greater gravitational pull of 4 M would suffice.  "
"At the neutral point N, the speed approaches zero.  "
The mechanical energy at N is purely potential.  
Earth satellites are objects which revolve around the earth.  
Their motion is very similar to the motion of planets around the Sun and hence Kepler's laws of planetary motion are equally applicable to them.  
"In particular, their orbits around the earth are circular or elliptic.  "
Moon is the only natural satellite of the earth with a near circular orbit with a time period of approximately 27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the rotational period of the moon about its own axis.  
"If m is the mass of the satellite and V its speed, the centripetal force required for this orbit is directed towards the center.  "
"This centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force,  "
Thus V decreases as h increases.  
"which is Kepler's law of periods, as applied to motion of satellites around the earth.  "
Which is approximately 85 minutes.  
"We note that the orbits of all planets except Mercury, Mars and Pluto are very close to being circular.  "
"For example, the ratio of the semi - minor to semi-major axis for our Earth is, b/a = 0.99986.  "
The moon is a satellite of the Earth.  
From the derivation of Kepler's third law  -LRB- see Eq.  -LRB- 8.38 -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"Both methods yield almost the same answer, the difference between them being less than 1 %.  "
The earth will then be at one of the foci of this ellipse.  
"Using Eq.  -LRB- 8.35 -RRB- , the kinetic energy of the satellite in a circular orbit with speed v is.  "
"Considering gravitational potential energy at infinity to be zero, the potential energy at distance  -LRB- R+h -RRB-  from the center of the earth is.  "
The K.E is positive whereas the P.E is negative.  
"The total energy of an circularly orbiting satellite is thus negative, with the potential energy being negative but twice is magnitude of the positive kinetic energy.  "
"When the orbit of a satellite becomes elliptic, both the K.E. and P.E. vary from point to point.  "
The total energy which remains constant is negative as in the circular orbit case.  
"This is what we expect, since as we have discussed before if the total energy is positive or zero, the object escapes to infinity.  "
Satellites are always at finite distance from the earth and hence their energies can not be positive or zero.  
Satellites in a circular orbits around the earth in the equatorial plane with T = 24 hours are called Geostationery Satellites.  
"Clearly, since the earth rotates with the same period, the satellite would appear fixed from any point on earth.  "
It takes very powerful rockets to throw up a satellite to such large heights above the earth but this has been done in view of the several benefits of many practical applications.  
It is known that electromagnetic waves above a certain frequency are not reflected from ionosphere.  
"Radio waves used for radio broadcast which are in the frequency range 2 MHz to 10 MHz, are below the critical frequency.  "
They are therefore reflected by the ionosphere.  
Thus radio waves broadcast from an antenna can be received at points far away where the direct wave fail to reach on account of the curvature of the earth.  
Waves used in television broadcast or other forms of communication have much higher frequencies and thus can not be received beyond the line of sight.  
The same principle holds good when we measure the weight of an object by a spring balance hung from a fixed point e.g. the ceiling.  
The object would fall down unless it is subject to a force opposite to gravity.  
This is exactly what the spring exerts on the object.  
This is because the spring is pulled down a little by the gravitational pull of the object and in turn the spring exerts a force on the object vertically upwards.  
"Now, imagine that the top end of the balance is no longer held fixed to the top ceiling of the room.  "
Both ends of the spring as well as the object move with identical acceleration g.  
The spring is not stretched and does not exert any upward force on the object which is moving down with acceleration g due to gravity.  
The reading recorded in the spring balance is zero since the spring is not stretched at all.  
"If the object were a human being, he or she will not feel his weight since there is no upward force on him.  "
"Thus, when an object is in free fall, it is weightless and this phenomenon is usually called the phenomenon of weightlessness.  "
Thus in the satellite everything inside it is in a state of free fall.  
This is just as if we were falling towards the earth from a height.  
"Thus, in a manned satellite, people inside experience no gravity.  "
"Gravity for us defines the vertical direction and thus for them there are no horizontal or vertical directions, all directions are the same.  "
Pictures of astronauts floating in a satellite reflect show this fact.  
"In Chapter 7, we studied the rotation of the bodies and then realized that the motion of a body depends on how mass is distributed within the body.  "
We restricted ourselves to simpler situations of rigid bodies.  
A rigid body generally means a hard solid object having a definite shape and size.  
"But in reality, bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent.  "
Even the appreciably rigid steel bar can be deformed when a sufficiently large external force is applied on it.  
This means that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.  
A solid has definite shape and size.  
"In order to change  -LRB- or deform -RRB-  the shape or size of a body, a force is required.  "
"If you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the length of the spring increases slightly.  "
"When you leave the ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape.  "
"The property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is known as elasticity and the deformation caused is known as elastic deformation.  "
"However, if you apply force to a lump of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their previous shape, and they get permanently deformed.  "
Such substances are called plastic and this property is called plasticity.  
Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics.  
The elastic behavior of materials plays an important role in engineering design.  
"For example, while designing a building, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel, concrete etc. is essential.  "
"The same is true in the design of bridges, automobiles, ropeways etc..  "
One could also ask — Can we design an aeroplane which is very light but sufficiently strong?  
Can we design an artificial limb which is lighter but stronger?  
Why does a railway track have a particular shape like I?  
Why is glass brittle while brass is not?  
Answers to such questions begin with the study of how relatively simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform different solids bodies.  
"In this chapter, we shall study the elastic behavior and mechanical properties of solids which would answer many such questions.  "
"We know that in a solid, each atom or molecule is surrounded by neighbouring atoms or molecules.  "
These are bonded together by interatomic or intermolecular forces and stay in a stable equilibrium position.  
"When a solid is deformed, the atoms or molecules are displaced from their equilibrium positions causing a change in the interatomic  -LRB- or intermolecular -RRB-  distances.  "
"When the deforming force is removed, the interatomic forces tend to drive them back to their original positions.  "
Thus the body regains its original shape and size.  
The restoring mechanism can be visualised by taking a model of spring-ball system shown in the Fig. 9.1.  
Here the balls represent atoms and springs represent interatomic forces.  
"If you try to displace any ball from its equilibrium position, the spring system tries to restore the ball back to its original position.  "
Thus elastic behavior of solids can be explained in terms of microscopic nature of the solid.  
"Robert Hooke, an English physicist  -LRB- 1635 - 1703 A.D -RRB-  performed experiments on springs and found that the elongation  -LRB- change in the length -RRB-  produced in a body is proportional to the applied force or load.  "
"In 1676, he presented his law of elasticity, now called Hooke's law.  "
We shall study about it in Section 9.4.  
"This law, like Boyle's law, is one of the earliest quantitative relationships in science.  "
It is very important to know the behavior of the materials under various kinds of load from the context of engineering design.  
"When a force is applied on body, it is deformed to a small or large extent depending upon the nature of the material of the body and the magnitude of the defor ming force.  "
The deformation may not be noticeable visually in many materials but it is there.  
"When a body is subjected to a deforming force, a restoring force is developed in the body.  "
This restoring force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the applied force.  
The restoring force per unit area is known as stress.  
The SI unit of stress is Nm—2 or pascal  -LRB- Pa -RRB-  and its dimensional formula is  -LRB- ML—1T—2 -RRB- .  
There are three ways in which a solid may change its dimensions when an external force acts on it.  
These are shown in Fig. 9.2.  
"In Fig.9.2 -LRB- a -RRB- , a cylinder is stretched by two equal forces applied normal to its cross-sectional area.  "
The restoring force per unit area in this case is called tensile stress.  
"If the cylinder is compressed under the action of applied forces, the restoring force per unit area is known as compressive stress.  "
Tensile or compressive stress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.  
"In both the cases, there is a change in the length of the cylinder.  "
The change in the length ΔL to the original length L of the body  -LRB- cylinder in this case -RRB-  is known as longitudinal strain.  
"However, if two equal and opposite deforming forces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 9.2 -LRB- b -RRB- , there is relative displacement between the opposite faces of the cylinder.  "
The restoring force per unit area developed due to the applied tangential force is known as tangential or shearing stress.  
"As a result of applied tangential force, there is a relative displacement Δx between opposite faces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 9.2 -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
The strain so produced is known as shearing strain and it is defined as the ratio of relative displacement of the faces Δx to the length of the cylinder L.  
"It can also be visualised, when a book is pressed with the hand and pushed horizontally, as shown in Fig. 9.2 -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
"In Fig. 9.2 -LRB- d -RRB- , a solid sphere placed in the fluid under high pressure is compressed uniformly on all sides.  "
"Nevertheless, the body still returns to its original dimension when the load is removed.  "
The point B in the curve is known as yield point  -LRB- also known as elastic limit -RRB-  and the corresponding stress is known as yield strength  -LRB- Sy -RRB-  of the material.  
"If the load is increased further, the stress developed exceeds the yield strength and strain increases rapidly even for a small change in the stress.  "
The portion of the curve between B and D shows this.  
"When the load is removed, say at some point C between B and D, the body does not regain its original dimension.  "
"In this case, even when the stress is zero, the strain is not zero.  "
The material is said to have a permanent set.  
The deformation is said to be plastic deformation.  
The point D on the graph is the ultimate tensile strength  -LRB- Su -RRB-  of the material.  
"Beyond this point, additional strain is produced even by a reduced applied force and fracture occurs at point E.  "
"If the ultimate strength and fracture points D and E are close, the material is said to be brittle.  "
"If they are far apart, the material is said to be ductile.  "
"As stated earlier, the stress-strain behavior varies from material to material.  "
"For example, rubber can be pulled to several times its original length and still returns to its original shape.  "
"Fig. 9.4 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of aorta, present in the heart.  "
"Note that although elastic region is very large, the material does not obey Hooke's law over most of the region.  "
"Secondly, there is no well defined plastic region.  "
"Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber etc. which can be stretched to cause large strains are called elastomers.  "
The proportional region within the elastic limit of the stress-strain curve  -LRB- region OA in Fig. 9.3 -RRB-  is of great importance for structural and manufacturing engineering designs.  
"The ratio of stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity, is found to be a characteristic of the material.  "
"Experimental observation show that for a given material, the magnitude of the strain produced is same whether the stress is tensile or compressive.  "
"Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the unit of Young's modulus is the same as that of stress i.e., N m—2 or Pascal  -LRB- Pa -RRB- .  "
Table 9.1 gives the values of Young's moduli and yield strengths of some materials.  
"From the data given in Table 9.1, it is noticed that for metals Young's moduli are large.  "
"Therefore, these materials require a large force to produce small change in length.  "
"To increase the length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm2 cross - sectional area by 0.1%, a force of 2000 N is required.  "
"The force required to produce the same strain in aluminium, brass and copper wires having the same cross-sectional area are 690 N, 900 N and 1100 N respectively.  "
"It means that steel is more elastic than copper, brass and aluminium.  "
The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called compressibility and is denoted by k.  
"It can be seen from the data given in Table 9.3 that the bulk moduli for solids are much larger than for liquids, which are again much larger than the bulk modulus for gases  -LRB- air -RRB- .  "
Thus solids are least compressible whereas gases are most compressible.  
Gases are about a million times more compressible than solids!  
"Gases have large compressibilities, which vary with pressure and temperature.  "
The incompressibility of the solids is primarily due to the tight coupling between the neighbouring atoms.  
The molecules in liquids are also bound with their neighbors but not as strong as in solids.  
Molecules in gases are very poorly coupled to their neighbors.  
Generally a large margin of safety  -LRB- of about a factor of ten in the load -RRB-  is provided.  
Thus a thicker rope of radius about 3 cm is recommended.  
A single wire of this radius would practically be a rigid rod.  
"So the ropes are always made of a number of thin wires braided together, like in pigtails, for ease in manufacture, flexibility and strength.  "
"A bridge has to be designed such that it can withstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force of winds and its own weight.  "
"Similarly, in the design of buildings use of beams and columns is very common.  "
"In both the cases, the overcoming of the problem of bending of beam under a load is of prime importance.  "
The beam should not bend too much or break.  
Let us consider the case of a beam loaded at the center and supported near its ends as shown in Fig. 9.8.  
This relation can be derived using what you have already learned and a little calculus.  
"From Eq.  -LRB- 9.16 -RRB- , we see that to reduce the bending for a given load, one should use a material with a large Young's modulus Y.  "
This is called buckling.  
"To avoid this, a common compromise is the cross-sectional shape shown in Fig. 9.9 -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
This section provides a large load-bearing surface and enough depth to prevent bending.  
This shape reduces the weight of the beam without sacrificing the strength and hence reduces the cost.  
Use of pillars or columns is also very common in buildings and bridges.  
A pillar with rounded ends as shown in Fig. 9.10 -LRB- a -RRB-  supports less load than that with a distributed shape at the ends  -LRB- Fig. 9.10 -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"The precise design of a bridge or a building has to take into account the conditions under which it will function, the cost and long period, reliability of usable materials etc..  "
The answer to the question why the maximum height of a mountain on earth is ~ 10 km can also be provided by considering the elastic properties of rocks.  
A mountain base is not under uniform compression and this provides some shearing stress to the rocks under which they can flow.  
The stress due to all the material on the top should be less than the critical shearing stress at which the rocks flow.  
"The material at the bottom experiences this force in the vertical direction, and the sides of the mountain are free.  "
Therefore this is not a case of pressure or bulk compression.  
"There is a shear component, approximately hρg itself.  "
Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is 30×107 Nm-2.  
"In this chapter, we shall study some common physical properties of liquids and gases.  "
"Liquids and gases can flow and are therefore, called fluids.  "
It is this property that distinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.  
Fluids are everywhere around us ; Earth has an envelop of air and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  
Water is not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian body constitute mostly of water.  
All the processes occurring in living beings including plants are mediated by fluids.  
Thus understanding the behavior and properties of fluids is important.  
How are fluids different from solids?  
What is common in liquids and gases?  
"Unlike a solid, a fluid has no definite shape of its own.  "
"Solids and liquids have a fixed volume, whereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container.  "
We have learned in the previous chapter that the volume of solids can be changed by stress.  
"The volume of solid, liquid or gas depends on the stress or pressure acting on it.  "
"When we talk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume under atmospheric pressure.  "
The difference between gases and solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change in volume due to change of external pressure is rather small.  
In other words solids and liquids have much lower compressibility as compared to gases.  
Shear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its volume fixed.  
The key property of fluids is that they offer very little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by application of very small shear stress.  
The shearing stress of fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.  
A sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it.  
"Hence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has to be perpendicular to the surface in contact with it.  "
This is shown in Fig.10.1  -LRB- a -RRB- .  
The normal force exerted by the fluid at a point may be measured.  
An idealised form of one such pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig. 10.1  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
"For a fluid of mass m occupying volume V,  -LRB- 10.3 -RRB- ; Its SI The dimensions of density are  -LRB- ML — 3 -RRB- .  "
Its SI unit is kgm — 3.  
It is a positive scalar quantity.  
"A liquid is largely incompressible and its density is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures.  "
"Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large variation in densities with pressure.  "
The relative density of a substance is the ratio of its density to the density of water at 4 o C.  
It is a dimensionless positive scalar quantity.  
For example the relative density of aluminium is 2.7.  
Its density is 2.7 × 10 3 kg m —3.  
The force acting on them is F = 40 kg wt = 400 N  -LRB- taking g = 10 m s — 2 -RRB- .  
"This force is acting vertically down and hence, normally on the femurs.  "
The French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that the pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all points if they are at the same height.  
This fact may be demonstrated in a simple way .  
Now consider a fluid element in the form of a horizontal bar of uniform cross-section ; The bar is in equilibrium.  
The horizontal forces exerted at its two ends must be balanced or the pressure at the two ends should be equal.  
This proves that for a liquid in equilibrium the pressure is same at all points in a horizontal plane.  
"Suppose the pressure were not equal in different parts of the fluid, then there would be a flow as the fluid will have some net force acting on it.  "
Hence in the absence of flow the pressure in the fluid must be same everywhere.  
Wind is flow of air due to pressure differences.  
Variation of Pressure with Depth Consider a fluid at rest in a container.  
In Fig. 10.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2.  
"Pressure difference depends on the vertical distance h between the points  -LRB- 1 and 2 -RRB- , mass density of the fluid ρ and acceleration due to gravity g.  "
"Thus, the pressure P, at depth below the surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is greater than atmospheric pressure by an amount ρ gh.  "
"Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli  -LRB- 1608-1647 -RRB-  devised for the first time, a method for measuring atmospheric pressure.  "
A long glass tube closed at one end and filled with mercury is inverted into a trough of mercury as shown in Fig.10.5  -LRB- a -RRB- .  
This device is known as mercury barometer.  
The space above the mercury column in the tube contains only mercury vapor whose pressure P is so small that it may be neglected.  
"The pressure inside the column at point A must equal the pressure at point B, which is at the same level.  "
Where ρ is the density of mercury and h is the  -LRB- 10.8 -RRB-  height of the mercury column in the tube.  
In the experiment it is found that the mercury column in the barometer has a height of about 76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere  -LRB- 1 atm -RRB- .  
This can also be obtained using the value of ρ in Eq.  -LRB- 10.8 -RRB- .  
A common way of stating pressure is in terms of cm or mm of mercury  -LRB- Hg -RRB- .  
A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a torr  -LRB- after Torricelli -RRB- .  
The mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine and physiology.  
"In meteorology, a common unit is the bar and millibar.  "
An open-tube manometer is a useful instrument for measuring pressure differences.  
One end of the tube is open to the atmosphere and other end is connected to the system whose pressure we want to measure  -LRB- see Fig. 10.5  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  
The pressure P at A is equal to pressure at point B.  
Pressure is same at the same level on both sides of the U-tube containing a fluid.  
For liquids the density varies very little over wide ranges in pressure and temperature and we can treat it safely as a constant for our present purposes.  
"Gases on the other hand, exhibits large variations of densities with changes in pressure and temperature.  "
"Unlike gases, liquids are therefore, largely treated as incompressible.  "
Let us now consider what happens when we change the pressure on a fluid contained in a vessel.  
Consider a horizontal cylinder with a piston and three vertical tubes at different points.  
The pressure in the horizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of liquid column in the vertical tubes.  
It is necessarily the same in all.  
"If we push the piston, the fluid level rises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level in each one of them.  "
"This indicates that when the pressure on the cylinder was increased, it was distributed uniformly throughout.  "
"We can say whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a fluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted undiminished and equally in all directions.  "
This is the Pascal's law for transmission of fluid pressure and has many applications in daily life.  
A number of devices such as hydraulic lift and hydraulic brakes are based on the Pascal's law.  
In these devices fluids are used for transmitting pressure.  
In a hydraulic lift as shown in Fig. 10.6 two pistons are separated by the space filled with a liquid.  
A piston of small cross section A 1 is used to exert a force F 1 directly on the liquid.  
Hydraulic brakes in automobiles also work Hydraulic brakes in automobiles also work on the same principle.  
"When we apply a little force on the pedal with our foot the master piston moves inside the master cylinder, and the pressure caused is transmitted through the brake oil to act on a piston of larger area.  "
A large force acts on the piston and is pushed down expanding the brake shoes against brake lining.  
"Hence, in steady flow, the map of flow is stationary in time.  "
How do we draw closely spaced streamlines?  
"If we intend to show streamline of every flowing particle, we would end up with a continuum of lines.  "
"Consider planes perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g., at three points P, R and Q in Fig.10.7  -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
The plane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries be determined by the same set of streamlines.  
"This means that number of fluid particles crossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q is the same.  "
The lost kinetic energy of the fluid gets converted into heat energy.  
"Thus, Bernoulli's equation ideally applies to fluids with zero viscosity or non-viscous fluids.  "
"Another restriction on application of Bernoulli theorem is that the fluids must be incompressible, as the elastic energy of the fluid is also not taken into consideration.  "
"In practice, it has a large number of useful applications and can help explain a wide variety of phenomena for low viscosity incompressible fluids.  "
"Bernoulli's equation also does not hold for non-steady or turbulent flows, because in that situation velocity and pressure are constantly fluctuating in time.  "
The word efflux means fluid outflow.  
Torricelli discovered that the speed of efflux from an open tank is given by a formula identical to that of a freely falling body.  
Consider a tank containing a liquid of density ρ with a small hole in its side at a height y 1 from the bottom  -LRB- see Fig. 10.10 -RRB- .  
Such a situation occurs in rocket propulsion.  
Equation  -LRB- 10.15 -RRB-  is known as Torricelli's law.  
Venturi-meter The Venturi-meter is a device to measure the flow speed of incompressible fluid.  
It consists of a tube with a broad diameter and a small constriction at the middle as shown in Fig.  -LRB- 10.11 -RRB- .  
"A manometer in the form of a U-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at the broad neck point of the tube and the other at constriction as shown in Fig.  -LRB- 10.11 -RRB- .  "
The manometer contains a liquid of density 1 of the liquid flowing through the tube ρ m.  
The from equation of continuity Eq.  -LRB- 10.10 -RRB-  the speed at the constriction becomes.  
Dynamic lift is the force that acts on a body.  
"Such as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning ball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid.  "
"In many games such as cricket, tennis, baseball, or golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates from its parabolic trajectory as it moves through air.  "
This deviation can be partly explained on the basis of Bernoulli's principle.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Ball moving with spin: A ball which is spinning drags air along with it.  
If the surface is rough more air will be dragged.  
Fig 10.13  -LRB- b -RRB-  shows the streamlines of air for a ball which is moving and spinning at the same time.  
The ball is moving forward and relative to it the air is moving backwards.  
"Therefore, the velocity of air above the ball relative to it is larger and below it is smaller.  "
This resistance to fluid motion is like an internal friction analogous to friction when a solid moves on a surface.  
It is called viscosity.  
We can study its consequences on an object falling through a viscous medium.  
We consider a raindrop in air.  
It accelerates initially due to gravity.  
"As the velocity increases, the retarding force also increases.  "
"Finally when viscous force where to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so does the acceleration.  "
The sphere  -LRB- raindrop -RRB-  then descends with a constant velocity.  
In a turbulent flow the velocity of the fluids at any point in space varies rapidly and randomly with time.  
Some circular motions called eddies are also generated.  
An obstacle placed in the path of a fast moving fluid causes turbulence  -LRB- Fig. 10.8  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"The smoke rising from a burning stack of wood, oceanic currents are turbulent.  "
Twinkling of stars is the result of atmospheric turbulence.  
"The wakes in the water and in the air left by cars, aeroplanes and boats are also turbulent.  "
Osborne Reynolds  -LRB- 1842-1912 -RRB-  observed that turbulent flow is less likely for viscous fluid flowing at low rates.  
"He defined a dimensionless number, whose value gives one an approximate idea whether the flow would be turbulent.  "
"For example when oil and water with their different densities and viscosities, flow in pipes of same shapes and sizes, turbulence sets in at almost the same value of R e.  "
Using this fact a small scale laboratory model can be set up to study the character of fluid flow.  
"They are useful in designing of ships, submarines, racing cars and aeroplanes ; e R = inertial force/force of viscosity.  "
Turbulence dissipates kinetic energy usually in the form of heat.  
Racing cars and planes are engineered to precision in order to minimize turbulence.  
The design of such vehicles involves experimentation and trial and error.  
On the other hand turbulence  -LRB- like friction -RRB-  is sometimes desirable.  
"Turbulence promotes mixing and increases the rates of transfer of mass, momentum and energy.  "
The blades of a kitchen mixer induce turbulent flow and provide thick milk shakes as well as beat eggs into a uniform texture.  
t Answer Let the speed of the flow be v and the diameter of the tap be d = 1.25 cm.  
All these and many more such experiences are related with the free surfaces of liquids.  
"As liquids have no definite shape but have a definite volume, they acquire a free surface when poured in a container.  "
These surfaces possess some additional energy.  
This phenomenon is known as surface tension and it is concerned with only liquid as gases do not have free surfaces.  
Let us now understand this phenomena.  
A liquid stays together because of attraction between molecules.  
Consider a molecule well inside a liquid.  
The intermolecular distances are such that it is attracted to all the surrounding molecules  -LRB- Fig. 10.16  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  
But the average potential energy of all the molecules is the same.  
Let us consider a molecule near the surface Fig. 10.16  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
Only lower half side of it is surrounded by liquid molecules.  
"There is some negative potential energy due to these, but obviously it is less than that of a molecule in bulk, i.e., the one fully inside.  "
Approximately it is half of the latter.  
"Thus, molecules on a liquid surface have some extra energy in comparison to molecules in the interior.  "
A liquid thus tends to have the least surface area which external conditions permit.  
Increasing surface area requires energy.  
Most surface phenomenon can be understood in terms of this fact.  
What is the energy required for having a molecule at the surface?  
"As mentioned above, roughly it is half the energy required to remove it entirely from the liquid i.e., half the heat of evaporation.  "
"Finally, what is a surface?  "
"The line is in equilibrium ; To be more specific, imagine a line of atoms or molecules at the surface.  "
The atoms to the left pull the line towards them; those to the right pull it towards them!  
This line of atoms is in equilibrium under tension.  
The value of surface tension depends on temperature.  
Now there is cohesion between the solid surface and the liquid.  
It can be directly measur ed experimentaly as schematically shown in Fig. 10.18.  
"A flat vertical glass plate, below which a vessel of some liquid is kept, forms one arm of the balance.  "
"The plate is balanced by weights on the other side, with its horizontal edge just over water.  "
The vessel is raised slightly till the liquid just touches the glass plate and pulls it down a little because of surface tension.  
Weights are added till the plate just clears water.  
Suppose the additional weight required is W.  
"Soaps, detergents and dying substances are wetting agents.  "
When they are added the angle of contact becomes small so that these may penetrate well and become effective.  
Water proofing agents on the other hand are added to create a large angle of contact between the water and fibers.  
Drops and Bubbles One consequence of surface tension is that free liquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects of gravity can be neglected.  
"You must have seen this especially clearly in small drops just formed in a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles blown by most of us in childhood.  "
Why are drops and bubbles spherical?  
What keeps soap bubbles stable?  
"As we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid - air interface has energy, so for a given volume the surface with minimum energy is the one with the least area.  "
The sphere has this property.  
"Though it is out of the scope of this book, but you can check that a sphere is better than at least a cube in this respect!  "
"So, if gravity and other forces  -LRB- e.g. air resistance -RRB-  were ineffective, liquid drops would be spherical.  "
Another interesting consequence of surface tension is that the pressure inside a spherical drop Fig. 10.20  -LRB- a -RRB-  is more than the pressure outside.  
Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is in equilibrium.  
"For example, an air bubble in a liquid, would have higher pressure inside it ; See Fig 10.20  -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
A bubble Fig 10.20  -LRB- c -RRB-  differs from a drop and a cavity; in this it has two interfaces.  
The answer has been rounded off to three significant figures.  
We all have common-sense notions of heat and temperature.  
Temperature is a measure of ' hotness ' of a body.  
A kettle with boiling water is hotter than a box containing ice.  
"In physics, we need to define the notion of heat, temperature, etc., more carefully.  "
"In this chapter, you will learn what heat is and how it is measured, and study the various proceses by which heat flows from one body to another.  "
"When an object is heated, many changes may take place.  "
"Its temperature may rise, it may expand or change state.  "
We will study the effect of heat on different bodies in later sections.  
A measure of temperature is obtained using a thermometer.  
Many physical properties of materials change sufficiently with temperature to be used as the basis for constructing thermometers.  
The commonly used property is variation of the volume of a liquid with temperature.  
"For example, a common thermometer  -LRB- the liquid-in-glass type -RRB-  with which you are familiar.  "
Mercury and alcohol are the liquids used in most liquid-in-glass thermometers.  
Thermometers are calibrated so that a numerical value may be assigned to a given temperature.  
"For the definition of any standard scale, two fixed reference points are needed.  "
"Since all substances change dimensions with temperature, an absolute r efer ence for expansion is not available.  "
"However, the necessary fixed points may be correlated to physical phenomena that always occur at the same temperature.  "
The ice point and the steam point of water are two convenient fixed points and are known as the freezing and boiling points.  
These two points are the temperatures at which pure water freezes and boils under standard pressure.  
The two familiar temperature scales are the Fahrenheit temperature scale and the Celsius temperature scale.  
Experiments show that all gases at low densities exhibit same expansion behavior.  
"When temperature is held constant, the pressure and volume of a quantity of gas are related as PV = constant.  "
"This relationship is known as Boyle's law, after Robert Boyle  -LRB- 1627-1691 -RRB-  the English Chemist who discovered it.  "
"When the pressure is held constant, the volume of a quantity of the gas is related to the temperature as V/T = constant.  "
"This relationship is known as Charles ' law, after the French scientist Jacques Charles  -LRB- 1747 - 1823 -RRB- .  "
"Low density gases obey these laws, which may be combined into a single relationship.  "
"Notice that since PV = constant and V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas, then PV / T should also be a constant.  "
This relationship is known as ideal gas law.  
This relationship allows a gas to be used to measure temperature in a constant volume gas thermometer.  
"Holding the volume of a gas constant, it gives P ∝ T.  "
"Thus, with a constant-volume gas thermometer, temperature is read in terms of pressure.  "
"A plot of pressure versus temperature gives a straight line in this case, as shown in Fig. 11.2.  "
But the relationship is linear though the pressure might reach zero with decreasing temperature if the gas continued to be a gas.  
"The absolute minimum temperature for an ideal gas, ther efore, inferr ed by extrapolating the straight line to the axis, as in Fig. 11.3.  "
This temperature is found to be — 273.15 ° C and is designated as absolute zero.  
Absolute zero is the foundation of the Kelvin temperature scale or absolute scale temperature named after the British scientist Lord Kelvin.  
"On this scale, — 273.15 ° C is taken as the zero point, that is 0 K  -LRB- Fig. 11.4 -RRB- .  "
"This would allow the metallic cover to expand, thereby loosening it to unscrew easily.  "
"In case of liquids, you may have observed that mercury in a thermometer rises, when the thermometer is put in a slightly warm water.  "
If we take out the thermometer from the warm water the level of mercury falls again.  
"Similarly, in the case of gases, a balloon partially inflated in a cool room may expand to full size when placed in warm water.  "
"On the other hand, a fully inflated balloon when immersed in cold water would start shrinking due to contraction of the air inside.  "
It is our common experience that most substances expand on heating and contract on cooling.  
A change in the temperature of a body causes change in its dimensions.  
The increase in the dimensions of a body due to the increase in its temperature is called thermal expansion.  
The expansion in length is called linear expansion.  
The expansion in area is called area expansion.  
The expansion in volume is called volume expansion  -LRB- Fig. 11.5 -RRB- .  
We find that copper the same rise in temperature.  
"Normally, metals expand more and have relatively high values of α l.  "
It Here α V is also a characteristic of the depends in general on temperature  -LRB- Fig 11.6 -RRB- .  
"Below 4 ° C, the volume increases, and therefore the density decreases  -LRB- Fig. 11.7  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
"As a lake cools toward 4 ° C, water near the surface loses energy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and sinks; the warmer, less dense water near the bottom rises.  "
"However, once the colder water on top reaches temperature below 4 ° C, it becomes less dense and remains at the surface, where it freezes.  "
"If water did not have this property, lakes and ponds would freeze from the bottom up, which would destroy much of their animal and plant life.  "
Gases at ordinary temperature expand more than solids and liquids.  
"You will find the time taken will be shorter and therefore, the quantity of heat required would be less than that required by the same amount of water for the same rise in temperature.  "
"The above observations show that the quantity of heat required to warm a given substance depends on its mass, m, the change in temperature, Δ T and the nature of substance.  "
"The change in temperature of a substance, when a given quantity of heat is absorbed or rejected by it, is characterised by a quantity called the heat capacity of that substance.  "
K — 1 The SI unit of specific heat capacity is J kg.  
The SI unit of molar specific heat capacity is J mol — 1 K — 1.  
"However, in connection with specific heat capacity of gases, additional conditions may be needed to define C.  "
"In this case, heat transfer can be achieved by keeping either pressure or volume constant.  "
"If the gas is held under constant pressure during the heat transfer, then it is called the molar specific heat capacity at constant pressure and is denoted by C p.  "
"On maintained during the heat transfer, then the corresponding molar specific heat capacity is called molar specific heat capacity at constant volume and is denoted by C v.  "
From Table 11.3 you can note that water has the highest specific heat capacity compared to other substances.  
"Owing to its high specific heat capacity, the water warms up much more slowly than the land during summer and consequently wind from the sea has a cooling effect.  "
"Now, you can tell why in desert areas, the earth surface warms up quickly during the day and cools quickly at night.  "
A system is said to be isolated if no exchange or transfer of heat occurs between the system and its surroundings.  
"When different parts of an isolated system are at different temperature, a quantity of heat transfers from the part at higher temperature to the part at lower temperature.  "
The heat lost by the part at higher temperature is equal to the heat gained by the part at lower temperature.  
Calorimetry means measurement of heat.  
A device in which heat measur ement can be made is called a calorimeter ; It consists a metallic vessel and stirrer of the same material like copper or alumiunium.  
The vessel is kept inside a wooden jacket which contains heat insulating materials like glass wool etc..  
The outer jacket acts as a heat shield and reduces the heat loss from the inner vessel.  
There is an opening in the outer jacket through which a mercury thermometer can be inserted into the calorimeter.  
"The following example provides a method by which the specific heat capacity of a given solid can be determinated by using the principle, heat gained is equal to the heat lost.  "
"Answer the fact that at a steady state, heat given by an aluminium sphere will be equal to the heat absorbed by the water and calorimeter.  "
A transition from one of these states to another is called a change of state.  
Two common changes of states are solid to liquid and liquid to gas  -LRB- and vice versa -RRB- .  
These changes can occur when the exchange of heat takes place between the substance and its surroundings.  
"To study the change of state on heating or cooling, let us perform the following activity.  "
Take some cubes of ice in a beaker.  
Note the temperature of ice  -LRB- 0 ° C -RRB- .  
Start heating it slowly on a constant heat source.  
Note the temperature after every minute.  
Continuously stir the mixture of water and ice.  
Draw a graph between temperature and time  -LRB- Fig. 11.9 -RRB- .  
You will observe no change in the temperature so long as there is ice in the beaker.  
"In the above process, the temperature of the system does not change even though heat is being continuously supplied.  "
The heat supplied is being utilised in changing the state from solid  -LRB- ice -RRB-  to liquid  -LRB- water -RRB- .  
The change of state from solid to liquid is called melting and from liquid to solid is called fusion.  
The temperature at which the solid and the liquid states of the substance in thermal equilibrium with each other is called its melting point.  
It is characteristic of the substance.  
It also depends on pressure.  
The melting point of a substance at standard atomspheric pressure is called its normal melting point.  
Let us do the following activity to understand the process of melting of ice.  
Take a slab of ice.  
"Take a metallic wire and fix two blocks, say 5 kg each, at its ends.  "
Put the wire over the slab as shown in Fig. 11.10.  
You will observe that the wire passes through the ice slab.  
"This happens due to the fact that just below the wire, ice melts at lower temperature due to increase in pressure.  "
"When the wire has passed, water above the wire freezes again.  "
Thus the wire passes through the slab and the slab does not split.  
This phenomenon of refreezing is called regelation.  
Skating is possible on snow due to the formation of water below the skates.  
Water is formed due to the increase of pressure and it acts as a lubricant.  
"After the whole of ice gets converted into water and as we continue further heating, we shall see that temperature begins to rise.  "
The temperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly 100 ° C when it again becomes steady.  
The heat supplied is now being utilised to change water from liquid state to vapor or gaseous state.  
"That is, both the liquid and vapor states of the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium, during the change of state from liquid to vapor.  "
The temperature at which the liquid and the vapor states of the substance coexist is called its boiling point.  
Let us do the following activity to understand the process of boiling of water.  
"Take a round-bottom flask, more than half filled with water.  "
"As water gets heated in the flask, note first that the air, which was dissolved in the water, will come out as small bubbles.  "
"Later, bubbles of steam will form at the bottom but as they rise to the cooler water near the top, they condense and disappear.  "
"Finally, as the temperature of the entire mass of the water reaches 100 ° C, bubbles of steam reach the surface and boiling is said to occur.  "
"The steam in the flask may not be visible but as it comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny droplets of water, giving a foggy appearance.  "
"Dry ice  -LRB- solid CO If now the steam outlet is closed for a few seconds to increase the pressure in the flask, you will notice that boiling stops.  "
More heat would be required to raise the temperature  -LRB- depending on the increase in pressure -RRB-  before boiling begins again.  
Thus boiling point increases with increase in pressure.  
Let us now remove the burner ; Allow water to cool to about 80 ° C.  
Remove the thermometer and steam outlet ; Close the flask with the airtight cork.  
Keep the flask turned upside down on the stand ; Pour ice-cold water on the flask.  
Water vapors in the flask condense reducing the pressure on the water surface inside the flask.  
"Water begins to boil again, now at a lower temperature.  "
Thus boiling point decreases with decrease in pressure.  
This explains why cooking is difficult on hills.  
"At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower, reducing the boiling point of water as compared to that at sea level.  "
"On the other hand, boiling point is increased inside a pressure cooker by increasing the pressure.  "
Hence cooking is faster.  
The boiling point of a substance at standard atmospheric pressure is called its normal boiling point.  
"However, all substances do not pass through the three states: solid-liquid-gas.  "
There are certain substances which normally pass from the solid to the vapor state directly and vice versa.  
"The change from solid state to vapor state without passing through the liquid state is called sublimation, and the substance is said to sublimes.  "
"During the sublimation process both the -RRB-  sublimes, so also solid and vapor states of a substance coexist in thermal equilibrium.  "
"In Section 11.8, we have learned that certain amount of heat energy is transferred between a substance and its surroundings when it undergoes a change of state.  "
"At this temperature, the addition of more heat does not increase the temperature but causes the ice to melt, or changes its state.  "
"Once the entire ice melts, adding more heat will cause the temperature of the water to rise.  "
A similar situation occurs during liquid gas change of state at the boiling point.  
"Adding more heat to boiling water causes vaporisation, without increase in temperature.  "
The heat required during a change of state depends upon the heat of transformation and the mass of the substance undergoing a change of state.  
Its SI unit is J kg — 1.  
The value of L also depends on the pressure.  
Its value is usually quoted at standard atmospheric pressure.  
A plot of temperature versus heat energy for a quantity of water is shown in Fig. 11.12.  
"The latent heats of some substances, their freezing and boiling points, are given in Table 11.5.  "
"Answer Note that when heat is added  -LRB- or removed -RRB-  during a change of state, the temperature remains constant.  "
"Note in Fig. 11.12 that the slopes of the phase lines are not all the same, which indicates that specific heats of the various states are not equal.  "
"Suppose one end of a metallic rod is put in a flame, the other end of the rod will soon be so hot that you can not hold it by your bare hands.  "
Here heat transfer takes place by conduction from the hot end of the rod through its different parts to the other end.  
Gases are poor thermal conductors while liquids have conductivities intermediate between solids and gases.  
Heat conduction may be described quantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a material for a given temperature difference.  
Consider a metallic bar of length L and uniform cross section A with its two ends maintained at different temperatures.  
Let us assume the and insulated so that no heat is exchanged between the sides and the surroundings.  
"The greater the value of K for a material, the more rapidly will it conduct heat.  "
The thermal conductivities of various substances are listed in Table 11.5.  
"These values vary slightly with temperature, but can be considered to be constant over a normal temperature range.  "
"Compare the relatively large thermal conductivities of the good thermal conductors, the metals, with the relatively small thermal conductivities of some good thermal insulators, such as wood and glass wool.  "
You may have noticed that some cooking pots have copper coating on the bottom.  
"Being a good conductor of heat, copper promotes the distribution of heat over the bottom of a pot for uniform cooking.  "
"Plastic foams, on the other hand, are good insulators, mainly because they contain pockets of air.  "
"Recall that gases are poor conductors, and note the low thermal conductivity of air in the Table 11.5.  "
Heat retention and transfer are important in many other applications.  
"Houses made of concrete roofs get very hot during summer days, because thermal conductivity of concrete  -LRB- though much smaller than that of a metal -RRB-  is still not small enough.  "
"Therefore, people usually prefer to give a layer of earth or foam insulation on the ceiling so that heat transfer is prohibited and keeps the room cooler.  "
"In some situations, heat transfer is critical.  "
"Therefore, heat flows only along the length of the rods.  "
Consider any cross section of the rod.  
"In the steady state, heat flowing into the element must equal the heat flowing out of it; otherwise there would be a net gain or loss of heat by the element and its temperature would not be steady.  "
"Thus in the steady state, rate of heat flowing across a cross section of the rod is the same at every point along the length of the combined steel-copper rod.  "
It is possible only in fluids.  
Convection can be natural or forced.  
"In natural convection, gravity plays an important part.  "
"When a fluid is heated from below, the hot part expands and, therefore, becomes less dense.  "
"Because of buoyancy, it rises and the upper colder part replaces it.  "
"This again gets heated, rises up and is replaced by the colder part of the fluid.  "
The process goes on.  
This mode of heat transfer is evidently dif fer ent fr om conduction.  
Convection involves bulk transport of different parts of the fluid.  
"In forced convection, material is forced to move by a pump or by some other physical means.  "
"The common examples of forced convection systems are forced-air heating systems in home, the human circulatory system, and the cooling system of an automobile engine.  "
"In the human body, the heart acts as the pump that circulates blood through different parts of the body, transferring heat by forced convection and maintaining it at a uniform temperature.  "
Air at the earth's surface near the equator is hot while the air in the upper atmosphere of the poles is cool.  
"The rotation of the earth, however, modifies this convection current.  "
"Because of this, air close to the equator has an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it is zero close to the poles.  "
This is called trade wind ; Conduction and convection require some material as a transport medium.  
These modes of heat transfer can not operate between bodies separated by a distance in vacuum.  
The third mechanism for heat transfer needs no medium; it is called radiation and the energy so radiated by electromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.  
In an electromagnetic wave electric and magnetic fields oscillate in space and time.  
"Like any wave, electromagnetic waves can have different wavelengths and can travel in vacuum with the same speed, namely the speed of light i.e., 3 × 10 8 m s — 1.  "
This is how heat is transfered to the earth from the sun through empty space.  
"All bodies emit radiant energy, whether they are solid, liquid or gases.  "
"When this thermal radiation falls on other bodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed.  "
The amount of heat that a body can absorb by radiation depends on the color of the body.  
We find that black bodies absorb and emit radiant energy better than bodies of lighter colors.  
This fact finds many applications in our daily life.  
"However, during winter, we use dark colored clothes which absorb heat from the sun and keep our body warm.  "
It consists of a double-walled glass vessel with the inner and outer walls coated with silver.  
Radiation from the inner wall is reflected back into the contents of the bottle.  
The outer wall similarly reflects back any incoming radiation.  
The space between the walls is evacuted to reduce conduction and convection losses and the flask is supported on an insulator like cork.  
"The device is, therefore, useful for preventing hot contents  -LRB- like milk -RRB-  from getting cold, or alternatively to store cold contents  -LRB- like ice -RRB- .  "
We all know that hot water or milk when left on a table begins to cool gradually.  
Ultimately it attains the temperature of the surroundings.  
"To study how a given body can cool on exchanging heat with its surroundings, let us perform the following activity.  "
"Take some water, say 300 ml, in a calorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with two holed lid.  "
Fix a thermometer through a hole in the lid and make sure that the bulb of thermometer is immersed in the water.  
Note the reading of the thermometer.  
This reading T 1 is the temperature of the surroundings.  
"attains a temperature, say, 40 ° C above room temperature  -LRB- i.e. temperature of the surroundings -RRB- .  "
Then stop heating the water by removing the heat source.  
"Start the stop - watch and note the reading of the thermometer after fixed interval of time, say after every one minute of stirring gently with the stirrer.  "
The above activity shows that a hot body loses heat to its surroundings in the form of heat radiation.  
The rate of loss of heat depends on the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings.  
"Newton was the first to study, in a systematic manner, the relation between the heat lost by a body in a given enclosure and its temperature.  "
In previous chapter we have studied thermal properties of matter.  
In this chapter we shall study laws that govern thermal energy.  
We shall study the processes where work is converted into heat and vice versa.  
"In winter, when we rub our palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing produces the ' heat '.  "
"Conversely, in a steam engine, the ' heat ' of the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons, which in turn rotate the wheels of the train.  "
"In physics, we need to define the notions of heat, temperature, work, etc. more carefully.  "
"Historically, it took a long time to arrive at the proper concept of ' heat '.  "
"Before the modern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid filling in the pores of a substance.  "
"On contact between a hot body and a cold body, the fluid  -LRB- called caloric -RRB-  flowed from the colder to the hotter body!  "
This is similar to what happens when a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water up to different heights.  
The flow continues until the levels of water in the two tanks are the same.  
"Likewise, in the ' caloric ' picture of heat, heat flows until the ' caloric levels '  -LRB- i.e., the temperatures -RRB-  equalise.  "
"In time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in favor of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy.  "
An important experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin Thomson  -LRB- also known as Count Rumford -RRB-  in 1798.  
"He observed that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of heat, indeed enough to boil water.  "
"More significantly, the amount of heat produced depended on the work done  -LRB- by the horses employed for turning the drill -RRB-  but not on the sharpness of the drill.  "
"In the caloric picture, a sharper drill would scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this was not observed.  "
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms of energy.  
Thermodynamics is a macroscopic science ; It deals with bulk systems and does not go into the molecular constitution of matter.  
"In fact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the nineteenth century before the molecular picture of matter was firmly established.  "
"Thermodynamic description involves relatively few macroscopic variables of the system, which are suggested by common sense and can be usually measured directly.  "
"A microscopic description of a gas, for example, would involve specifying the co-ordinates and velocities of the huge number of molecules constituting the gas.  "
The description in kinetic theory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve molecular distribution of velocities.  
"Thermodynamic description of a gas, on the other hand, avoids the molecular description altogether.  "
"Instead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is specified by macroscopic variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, mass and composition that are felt by our sense perceptions.  "
and are measurable The distinction between mechanics and The distinction between mechanics and thermodynamics is worth bearing in mind.  
"In mechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles or bodies under the action of forces and torques.  "
Thermodynamics is not concerned with the motion of the system as a whole.  
It is concerned with the internal macroscopic state of the body.  
"When a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes is the mechanical state of the bullet  -LRB- its kinetic energy, in particular -RRB- , not its temperature.  "
"When the bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic energy of the bullet gets converted into heat, changing the temperature of the bullet and the surrounding layers of wood.  "
"Temperature is related to the energy of the internal  -LRB- disordered -RRB-  motion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet as a whole.  "
Equilibrium in mechanics means that the net external force and torque on a system are zero.  
The term ' equilibrium ' in thermodynamics appears in a different context: we say the state of a system is an equilibrium state if the macroscopic variables that characterise the system do not change in time.  
"In general, whether or not a system is in a state of equilibrium depends on the surroundings and the nature of the wall that separates the system from the surroundings.  "
Consider two gases A and B occupying two different containers.  
We know experimentally that pressure and volume of a given mass of gas can be chosen to be its two independent variables.  
The systems are insulated from the rest of the surroundings also by similar adiabatic walls.  
The situation is shown schematically in Fig. 12.1  -LRB- a -RRB- .  
It is then found that the macroscopic variables of the systems A and B change spontaneously until both the systems attain equilibrium states.  
After that there is no change in their states.  
The situation is shown in Fig. 12.1  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
There is no more energy flow from one to another.  
We then say that the system A is in thermal equilibrium with the system B.  
What characterises the situation of thermal equilibrium between two systems?  
You can guess the answer from your experience.  
"In thermal equilibrium, the temperatures of the two systems are equal.  "
We shall see how does one arrive at the concept of temperature in thermodynamics?  
The Zeroth law of thermodynamics provides the clue.  
"Imagine two systems A and B, separated by an adiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third system C, via a conducting wall  -LRB- Fig. 12.2  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
"The states of the systems  -LRB- i.e., their macroscopic variables -RRB-  will change until both A and B come to thermal equilibrium with C.  "
It is found that the states of A and B change no further i.e. they are found to be in thermal equilibrium with each other.  
"The Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two systems A and B, are in thermal equilibrium, there must be a physical quantity that has the same value for both.  "
This thermodynamic variable whose value is equal for two systems in thermal equilibrium is called temperature  -LRB- T -RRB- .  
This implies that We have arrived at the concept of temperature formally via the Zeroth Law.  
The next question is: how to assign numerical values to temperatures of different bodies?  
"In other words, how do we construct a scale of temperature?  "
Thermometry deals with this basic question to which we turn in the next section.  
 -LRB- b -RRB-  while C is insulated from A and B by an adiabatic wall.  
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to the concept of temperature that agrees with our commonsense notion.  
Temperature is a marker of the ' hotness ' of a body.  
It determines the direction of flow of heat when two bodies are placed in thermal contact.  
Heat flows from the body at a higher temperature to the one at lower temperature.  
The flow stops when the temperatures equalise; the two bodies are then in thermal equilibrium.  
We saw in some detail how to construct temperature scales to assign temperatures to dif ferent bodies.  
We now describe the concepts of heat and other relevant quantities like internal energy and work.  
The concept of internal energy of a system is not difficult to understand.  
We know that every bulk system consists of a large number of molecules.  
Internal energy is simply the sum of the kinetic energies and potential energies of these molecules.  
"We remarked earlier that in thermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the system, as a whole, is not relevant.  "
"Internal energy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and potential energies in the frame of reference relative to which the center of mass of the system is at rest.  "
"Thus, it includes only the  -LRB- disordered -RRB-  energy associated with the random motion of molecules of the system.  "
We denote the internal energy of a system by U.  
"Though we have invoked the molecular picture to understand the meaning of internal energy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned, U is simply a macroscopic variable of the system.  "
"The important thing about internal energy is that it depends only on the state of the system, not on how that state was achieved.  "
"Thus, the internal energy of a given mass of gas depends on its state described by specific values of pressure, volume and temperature.  "
It does not depend on how this state of the gas came about.  
"Pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy are thermodynamic state variables of the system  -LRB- gas -RRB-   -LRB- see section 12.7 -RRB- .  "
"If we neglect the small intermolecular forces in a gas, the internal energy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies associated with various random motions of its molecules.  "
What are the ways of changing internal energy of a system?  
"Consider again, for simplicity, the system to be a certain mass of gas contained in a cylinder with a movable piston as shown in Fig. 12.4.  "
Experience shows there are two ways of changing the state of the gas  -LRB- and hence its internal energy -RRB- .  
One way is to put the cylinder in contact with a body at a higher temperature than that of the gas.  
"The temperature difference will cause a flow of energy  -LRB- heat -RRB-  from the hotter body to the gas, thus increasing the internal energy of the gas.  "
"With surroundings at a lower temperature, heat would flow from the gas to the surroundings.  "
"Likewise, the gas could push the piston up and do work on the surroundings.  "
"In short, heat and work are two different modes of altering the state of a thermodynamic system and changing its internal energy.  "
The notion of heat should be carefully distinguished from the notion of internal energy.  
"Heat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in transit.  "
This is not just a play of words.  
The distinction is of basic significance.  
"The state of a thermodynamic system is characterised by its internal energy, not heat.  "
"However, Δ Q and Δ W will, in general, depend on the path taken to go from the initial to final states.  "
"From the First Law of Thermodynamics, Eq.  -LRB- 12.2 -RRB- , it is clear that the combination Δ Q — Δ W, is however, path independent.  "
"If the system is a gas in a cylinder with a movable piston, the gas in moving the piston does work.  "
Suppose an amount of heat Δ Q supplied to a substance changes its temperature from T to T + Δ T.  
"We define heat capacity of a substance  -LRB- see Chapter 11 -RRB-  to be Δ  -LRB- 12.4 -RRB-  We expect Δ Q and, therefore, heat capacity S to be proportional to the mass of the substance.  "
"Further, it could also depend on the temperature, i.e., a different amount of heat may be needed for a unit rise in temperature at different temperatures.  "
The unit of — 1 K specific heat capacity is J kg.  
The unit of C is J mo1 — 1 K — 1.  
"As we shall see later  -LRB- in connection with specific heat capacity of gases -RRB- , additional conditions may be needed to define C or s.  "
The idea in defining C is that simple predictions can be made in regard to molar specific heat capacities.  
Table 12.1 lists measured specific and molar heat capacities of solids at atmospheric pressure and ordinary room temperature.  
We will see in Chapter 13 that predictions of specific heats of gases generally agree with experiment.  
We can use the same law of equipartition of energy that we use there to predict molar specific heat capacities of solids.  
"Consider a solid of N atoms, each vibrating about its mean position.  "
The agreement is known to break down at low temperatures.  
Specific heat capacity of water The old unit of heat was calorie.  
"Figure 12.5 shows this variation in the temperature range 0 to 100 ° C. For a precise definition of calorie, it was, therefore, necessary to specify the unit temperature interval.  "
"As already remarked, the specific heat capacity depends on the process or the conditions under which heat capacity transfer takes place.  "
"For gases, for example, we can define two specific heats: specific heat capacity at constant volume and specific C ideal gas, we have a simple relation ; heat capacity at constant pressure.  "
"During the rapid expansion, pressure of the gas may not be uniform throughout.  "
"Eventually, the gas attains a uniform temperature and pressure and comes to thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings.  "
"In short, thermodynamic state variables describe equilibrium states of systems.  "
The various state variables are not necessarily independent.  
The connection between the state variables is called the equation of state.  
The pressure-volume curve for a fixed temperature is called an isotherm.  
Real gases may have more complicated equations of state.  
The thermodynamic state variables are of two kinds: extensive and intensive.  
Extensive variables indicate the ' size ' of the system ; Intensive variables such as pressure and temperature do not.  
"To decide which variable is extensive and which intensive, think of a relevant system in equilibrium, and imagine that it is divided into two equal parts.  "
It is a good practice to check the consistency of thermodynamic equations using this classification of variables.  
Consider a gas in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings.  
The pressure of the gas in that case equals the external pressure and its temperature is the same as that of its surroundings.  
Suppose that the external pressure is suddenly reduced  -LRB- say by lifting the weight on the movable piston in the container -RRB- .  
The piston will accelerate outward.  
"During the process, the gas passes through states that are not equilibrium states.  "
The non - equilibrium states do not have well-defined pressure and temperature.  
"In the same way, if a finite temperature difference exists between the gas and its surroundings, there will be a rapid exchange of heat during which the gas will pass through non-equilibrium states.  "
"In due course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium state with well-defined temperature and pressure equal to those of the surroundings.  "
"The free expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture of gases undergoing an explosive chemical reaction, mentioned in section 12.7 are also examples where the system goes through non - equilibrium states.  "
Non-equilibrium states of a system are difficult to deal with.  
"It is, therefore, convenient to imagine an idealised process in which at every stage the system is an equilibrium state.  "
"The system changes its variables  -LRB- P, T, V -RRB-  so slowly that it remains in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings throughout.  "
"Finally, if the system is insulated from the surroundings and no heat flows between the system and the surroundings, the process is adiabatic.  "
The definitions of these special processes are summarised in Table.  
This is nothing but Boyle's Law.  
"For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature.  "
"Thus, there is no change in the internal energy of an ideal gas in an isothermal process.  "
The First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that heat supplied to the gas equals the work done by the gas: Q = W.  
"In an adiabatic process, the system is insulated from the surroundings and heat absorbed or released is zero.  "
"From Eq.  -LRB- 12.1 -RRB- , we see that work done by the gas results in decrease in its internal energy  -LRB- and hence its temperature for an ideal gas -RRB- .  "
No work is done on or by the gas.  
"From Eq.  -LRB- 12.1 -RRB- , the heat absorbed by the gas goes entirely to change its internal energy and its temperature.  "
The change in temperature for a given amount of heat is determined by the specific heat of the gas at constant volume.  
"Isobaric process In an isobaric process, P is fixed.  "
The heat absorbed goes partly to increase internal energy and partly to do work.  
The change in temperature for a given amount of heat is determined by the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure.  
"Cyclic process In a cyclic process, the system returns to its initial state.  "
"Since internal energy is a state variable, Δ U = 0 for a cyclic process.  "
"From Eq.  -LRB- 12.1 -RRB- , the total heat absorbed equals the work done by the system.  "
"where Q 1 is the heat input i.e., the heat and W is the work done on the environment in a cycle and W is the work done on the environment in a cycle.  "
"But experience shows that such an ideal engine with η = 1 is never possible, even if we can eliminate various kinds of losses associated with actual heat engines.  "
"It turns out that there is a fundamental limit on the efficiency of a heat engine set by an independent principle of nature, called the Second Law of Thermodynamics  -LRB- section 12.11 -RRB- .  "
The mechanism of conversion of heat into work varies for different heat engines.  
The various steps involved in a cycle also differ from one engine to another.  
"For the purpose of general analysis, it is useful to conceptualise a heat engine as having the following essential ingredients.  "
A refrigerator is the reverse of a heat engine.  
A heat pump is the same as a refrigerator.  
What term we use depends on the purpose of the device.  
 -LRB- a -RRB-  sudden expansion of the gas from high to low pressure which cools it and converts it into a vapour-liquid mixture.  
 -LRB- b -RRB-  absorption by the cold fluid of heat from the region to be cooled converting it into vapor.  
 -LRB- c -RRB-  heating up of the vapor due to external work done on the system.  
" -LRB- d -RRB-  release of heat by the vapor to the surroundings, bringing it to the initial state and completing the cycle.  "
The coefficient of performance  -LRB- α -RRB-  of a refrigerator is given by  -LRB- 12.21 -RRB-  where Q 2 is the heat extracted from the cold system — the refrigerant.  
The First Law of Thermodynamics is the principle of conservation of energy.  
Common experience shows that there are many conceivable processes that are perfectly allowed by the First Law and yet are never observed.  
"For example, nobody has ever seen a book lying on a table jumping to a height by itself.  "
But such a thing would be possible if the principle of conservation of energy were the only restriction.  
But this never happens.  
"Clearly, some additional basic principle of nature forbids the above, even though it satisfies the energy conservation principle.  "
"This principle, which disallows many phenomena consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics is known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  "
The Second Law of Thermodynamics gives a fundamental limitation to the efficiency of a heat engine and the co-efficient of performance of a refrigerator.  
"In simple terms, it says that efficiency of a heat engine can never be unity.  "
"According to Eq.  -LRB- 12.20 -RRB- , this implies that heat released to the cold reservoir can never be made zero.  "
"For a refrigerator, the Second Law says that the co-efficient of performance can never be infinite.  "
"According to Eq.  -LRB- 12.21 -RRB- , this implies that external work  -LRB- W -RRB-  can never be zero.  "
Second Law of Thermodynamics Kelvin-Planck statement No process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and the complete conversion of the heat into work.  
Clausius statement No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a hotter object.  
It can be proved that the two statements above are completely equivalent.  
Imagine some process in which a thermodynamic system goes from an initial state i to a final state f.  
During the process the system absorbs heat Q from the surroundings and performs work W on it.  
Can we reverse this process and bring both the system and surroundings to their initial states with no other effect anywhere?  
Experience suggests that for most processes in nature this is not possible.  
The spontaneous processes of nature are irreversible.  
Several examples can be cited.  
The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter than its other parts.  
"When the vessel is removed, heat is transferred from the base to the other parts, bringing the vessel to a uniform temperature  -LRB- which in due course cools to the temperature of the surroundings -RRB- .  "
The process can not be reversed; a part of the vessel will not get cooler spontaneously and warm up the base.  
"It will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, if it did.  "
The free expansion of a gas is irreversible.  
The combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol and air ignited by a spark can not be reversed.  
Cooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the entire room.  
The diffusion process will not spontaneously reverse and bring the gas back to the cylinder.  
"The stirring of a liquid in thermal contact with a reservoir will convert the work done into heat, increasing the internal energy of the reservoir.  "
"The process can not be reversed exactly; otherwise it would amount to conversion of heat entirely into work, violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  "
Irreversibility is a rule rather an exception in nature.  
"Since dissipative effects are present everywhere and can be minimized but not fully eliminated, most processes that we deal with are irreversible.  "
"From the preceding discussion, a reversible process is an idealised notion.  "
A process is reversible only if it is quasi-static  -LRB- system in equilibrium with the surroundings at every stage -RRB-  and there are no dissipative effects.  
"For example, a quasi-static isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a cylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston is a reversible process.  "
Why is reversibility such a basic concept in thermodynamics?  
"As we have seen, one of the concerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency with which heat can be converted into work.  "
The Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out the possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100 % efficiency.  
But what is the highest efficiency possible for a heat engine working between two reservoirs at temperatures T 1 and T 2?  
It turns reversible processes achieves the highest efficiency possible.  
All other engines involving irreversibility in any way  -LRB- as would be the case for practical engines -RRB-  have lower than this limiting efficiency.  
Suppose we have a hot reservoir at temperature T 1 and a cold reservoir at temperature T 2.  
What engine operating between the two reservoirs and what cycle of processes should be adopted to achieve the maximum efficiency?  
"Sadi Carnot, a French engineer, first considered this question in 1824.  "
"Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the correct answer, even though the basic concepts of heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly established.  "
We expect the ideal engine operating between two temperatures to be a reversible engine.  
"Irreversibility is associated with dissipative effects, as remarked in the preceding section, and lowers efficiency.  "
A process is reversible if it is quasi-static and non-dissipative.  
We have seen that a process is not quasi-static if it involves finite temperature difference between the system and the reservoir.  
"To from the hot reservoir, and 2 complete a cycle, we need to take the system from temperature T2 to T1.  "
"Which processes should to T 2 and then back from A little reflection shows that we can only adopt reversible adiabatic processes for these purposes, which involve no heat flow from any reservoir.  "
Thus adiabatic processes must bring about the temperature change in the system from T 2 to T 1 1 to T in this engine.  
"We have just argued that such an engine must have the following sequence of steps constituting one cycle, called the Carnot cycle, shown in Fig. 12.11.  "
We have taken the working substance of the Carnot engine to be an ideal gas.  
Indeed it is the only reversible engine possible that works between two reservoirs at different temperatures.  
Each step of the Carnot cycle given in Fig. 12.11 can be reversed.  
"Let us couple the engines, I and R, in such a way so that I acts like a heat engine and R acts as a refrigerator.  "
This is clearly against the Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  
The maximum efficiency of a Carnot engine given by Eq.  -LRB- 12.32 -RRB-  is independent of the nature of the system performing the Carnot cycle of operations.  
Thus we are justified in using an ideal gas as a system in the calculation of efficiency η of a Carnot engine.  
"The ideal gas has a simple equation of state, which allows us to readily calculate η, but the final result for η,  -LRB- Eq.  -LRB- 12.32 -RRB-  -RRB- , is true for any Carnot engine.  "
"This final remark shows that in a Carnot cycle, is a universal relation independent of the nature of the system.  "
"Here Q1 and Q2 are respectively,  -LRB- from the hot and to the cold reservoirs -RRB-  in a Carnot engine.  "
Boyle discovered the law named after him in 1661.  
"Boyle, Newton and several others tried to explain the behavior of gases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic particles.  "
The actual atomic theory got established more than 150 years later.  
Kinetic theory explains the behavior of gases based on the idea that the gas consists of rapidly moving atoms or molecules.  
"This is possible as the inter-atomic forces, which are short range forces that are important for solids and liquids, can be neglected for gases.  "
"The kinetic theory was developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell, Boltzmann and others.  "
It has been remarkably successful.  
"It gives a molecular interpretation of pressure and temperature of a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and Avogadro's hypothesis.  "
It correctly explains specific heat capacities of many gases.  
"It also relates measurable properties of gases such as viscosity, conduction and diffusion with molecular parameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses.  "
This chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.  
"Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century considers the discovery that ""Matter is made up of atoms "" to be a very significant one.  "
Humanity may suffer annihilation  -LRB- due to nuclear catastrophe -RRB-  or extinction  -LRB- due to environmental disasters -RRB-  if we do not act wisely.  
"If that happens, and all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed then Feynman would like the ' Atomic Hypothesis ' to be communicated to the next generation of creatures in the universe.  "
"Speculation that matter may not be continuous, existed in many places and cultures.  "
Kanada in India and Democritus in Greece had suggested that matter may consist of indivisible constituents.  
The scientific 'Atomic Theory' is usually credited to John Dalton.  
He proposed the atomic theory to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions obeyed by elements when they combine into compounds.  
"The first law says that any given compound has, a fixed proportion by mass of its constituents.  "
"The second law says that when two elements form more than one compound, for a fixed mass of one element, the masses of the other elements are in ratio of small integers.  "
"To explain the laws Dalton suggested, about 200 years ago, that the smallest constituents of an element are atoms.  "
Atoms of one element are identical but differ from those of other elements.  
A small number of atoms of each element combine to form a molecule of the compound.  
"Gay Lussac's law, also given in early 19 th century, states: When gases combine chemically to yield another gas, their volumes are in the ratios of small integers.  "
Avogadro's law  -LRB- or hypothesis -RRB-  says: Equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules.  
"Avogadro's law, when combined with Dalton's theory explains Gay Lussac's law.  "
"Since the elements are often in the form of molecules, Dalton's atomic theory can also be referred to as the molecular theory of matter.  "
The theory is now well accepted by scientists.  
However even at the end of the nineteenth century there were famous scientists who did not believe in atomic theory!  
"From many observations, in recent times we now know that molecules  -LRB- made up of one or more atoms -RRB-  constitute matter.  "
Electron microscopes and scanning tunnelling microscopes enable us to even see them.  
The size of an atom is about an angstrom  -LRB- 1Å -RRB-   -LRB- 10-10 m -RRB- .  
"In solids, which are tightly packed, atoms are spaced about a few angstroms  -LRB- 2Å -RRB-  apart.  "
In liquids the separation between atoms is also about the same.  
"In liquids the atoms are not as rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move around.  "
This enables a liquid to flow.  
In gases the interatomic distances are in tens of angstroms.  
The average distance a molecule can travel without colliding is called the mean free path.  
"The mean free path, in gases, is of the order of thousands of angstroms.  "
The atoms are much freer in gases and can travel long distances without colliding.  
"If they are not enclosed, gases disperse away.  "
In solids and liquids the closeness makes the interatomic force important.  
The force has a long range attraction and a short range repulsion.  
The atoms attract when they are at a few angstroms but repel when they come closer.  
The static appearance of a gas is misleading.  
The gas is full of activity and the equilibrium is a dynamic one.  
"In dynamic equilibrium, molecules collide and change their speeds during the collision.  "
Only the average properties are constant.  
"Atomic theory is not the end of our quest, but the beginning.  "
We now know that atoms are not indivisible or elementary.  
It is called nucleus and electrons.  
The nucleus itself is made up of protons and neutrons.  
The protons and neutrons are again made up of quarks.  
Even As quarks may not be the end of the story.  
There may be string like elementary entities.  
"Nature always has surprises for us, but the search for truth is often enjoyable and the discoveries beautiful.  "
"In this chapter, we shall limit ourselves to understanding the behavior of gases  -LRB- and a little bit of solids -RRB- , as a collection of moving molecules in incessant motion.  "
Properties of gases are easier to understand than those of solids and liquids  
"If P, V and T are same, then N is also same for all gases.  "
"This is Avogadro's hypothesis, that the number of molecules per unit volume is same for all gases at a fixed temperature and pressure.  "
The number in 22.4 litres of any gas is 6.02 × 1023.  
This is known as Avogadro number and is denoted by NA.  
This amount of substance is called a mole  -LRB- see Chapter 2 for a more precise definition -RRB- .  
Avogadro had guessed the equality of numbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed temperature and pressure from chemical reactions.  
Kinetic theory justifies this hypothesis.  
An ideal gas is a simple theoretical model of a gas.  
No real gas is truly ideal.  
Fig. 13.1 shows departures from ideal gas behavior for a real gas at three different temperatures.  
Notice that all curves approach the ideal gas behavior for low pressures and high temperatures.  
At low pressures or high temperatures the molecules are far apart and molecular interactions are negligible.  
Without interactions the gas behaves like an ideal one.  
This is the famous Boyle's law.  
Once again you see that the agreement is good at high temperatures and low pressures.  
This is Dalton's law of partial pressures.  
This is called the partial pressure of the gas.  
"Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is the sum of partial pressures.  "
A given mass of water in vapor state has 1.67×103 times the volume of the same mass of water in liquid state.  
The collisions are considered to be elastic.  
We can derive an expression for the pressure of a gas based on the kinetic theory.  
"We begin with the idea that molecules of a gas are in incessant random motion, colliding against one another and with the walls of the container.  "
All collisions between molecules among themselves or between molecules and the walls are elastic.  
This implies that total kinetic energy is conserved.  
The total momentum is conserved as usual.  
"Consider a gas enclosed in a cube of side l. Take the axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube, as shown in Fig. 13.4.  "
"Since the collision is elastic, in the collision the molecule rebounds with the same velocity.  "
"But, on the average, half of these are moving towards the wall and the other half away from the wall.  "
"Actually, all molecules in a gas do not have the same velocity; there is a distribution in velocities.  "
"The above equation therefore, stands for pressure due to the group of molecules with speed vx in the x-direction and n stands for the number density of that group of molecules.  "
The total pressure is obtained by summing over the contribution due to all groups.  
"Now the gas is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction of velocity of the molecules in the vessel.  "
"First, though we choose the container to be a cube, the shape of the vessel really is immaterial.  "
"For a vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose a small infinitesimal  -LRB- planar -RRB-  area and carry through the steps above.  "
Notice that both A and Δt do not appear in the final result.  
"By Pascal's law, given in Ch. 10, pressure in one portion of the gas in equilibrium is the same as anywhere else.  "
"Second, we have ignored any collisions in the derivation.  "
"Though this assumption is difficult to justify rigorously, we can qualitatively see that it will not lead to erroneous results.  "
The number of molecules hitting the wall in time Δt was found to be ½n Avx Δt.  
Now the collisions are random and the gas is in a steady state.  
"If this were not so, the distribution of velocities would not remain steady.  "
In any case we are finding vx2.  
The quantity in the bracket is the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules in the gas.  
We are now ready for a kinetic interpretation of temperature.  
"The average kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas; it is independent of pressure, volume or the nature of the ideal gas.  "
"For a mixture of non-reactive ideal gases, the total pressure gets contribution from each gas in the mixture.   "
"From Eq.  -LRB- 13.19 -RRB- , we can get an idea of the typical speed of molecules in a gas.  "
The speed is of the order of the speed of sound in air.  
"It follows from Eq.  -LRB- 13.19 -RRB-  that at the same temperature, lighter molecules have greater rms speed.  "
"It depends only on temperature, and is independent of the nature of the gas.  "
"Since argon and chlorine both have the same, and temperature in the flask, the ratio of average kinetic energy  -LRB- per molecule -RRB-  of the two gases is 1:1.  "
"For argon, a molecule is just an atom of argon.  "
You should note that the composition of the mixture by mass is quite irrelevant to the above calculation.  
"Any other proportion by mass of argon and chlorine would give the same answers to  -LRB- i -RRB-  and  -LRB- ii -RRB- , provided the temperature remains unaltered.  "
At a fixed temperature the average energy = ½m -LRB- v2 -RRB-  is constant.  
"So smaller the mass of the molecule, faster will be the speed.  "
The ratio of speeds is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of the masses.  
235U is the isotope needed for nuclear fission.  
"To separate it from the more abundant isotope 238U, the mixture is surrounded by a porous cylinder.  "
"The porous cylinder must be thick and narrow, so that the molecule wanders through individually, colliding with the walls of the long pore.  "
The method is not very efficient and has to be repeated several times for sufficient enrichment. -RRB- .  
"When gases diffuse, their rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to square root of the masses  -LRB- see Exercise 13.12 -RRB- .  "
Can you guess the explanation from the above answer?  
Let the speed of the ball be u relative to the wicket behind the bat.  
"If the bat is moving towards the ball with a speed V relative to the wicket, then the relative speed of the ball to bat is V + u towards the bat.  "
"When the ball rebounds  -LRB- after hitting the massive bat -RRB-  its speed, relative to bat, is V + u moving away from the bat.  "
"So relative to the wicket the speed of the rebounding ball is V +  -LRB- V + u -RRB-  = 2V + u, moving away from the wicket.  "
So the ball speeds up after the collision with the bat.  
The rebound speed will be less than u if the bat is not massive.  
For a molecule this would imply an increase in temperature.  
You should be able to answer  -LRB- b -RRB-   -LRB- c -RRB-  and  -LRB- d -RRB-  based on the answer to  -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"Here ω1 and ω2 are the angular speeds about the axes 1 and 2 and I1, I2 are the corresponding moments of inertia.  "
Note that each rotational degree of freedom contributes a term to the energy that contains square of a rotational variable of motion.  
"We have assumed above that the O2 molecule is a ‘rigid rotator’, i.e. the molecule does not vibrate.  "
"This assumption, though found to be true  -LRB- at moderate temperatures -RRB-  for O2, is not is not always valid.  "
Here k is the force constant of the oscillator and y the vibrational co-ordinate.  
Once again the vibrational energy terms in Eq.  -LRB- 13.26 -RRB-  contain squared terms of vibrational variables of motion y and dy/dt.  
Each quadratic term occurring in the expression for energy is a mode of absorption of energy by the molecule.  
"We have seen that in thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T, for each translational mode of motion, the average energy is ½ kBT.  "
"A most elegant principle of classical statistical mechanics  -LRB- first proved by Maxwell -RRB-  states that this is so for each mode of energy: translational, rotational and vibrational.  "
"That is, in equilibrium, the total energy is equally distributed in all possible energy modes, with each mode having an average energy equal to ½ kBT.  "
This is known as the law of equipartition of energy.  
"Accordingly, each translational and rotational degree of freedom of a molecule contributes ½ kBT to the energy while each vibrational frequency contributes 2 × ½ kBT = kBT.  "
The proof of the law of equipartition of energy is beyond the scope of this book.  
Here we shall apply the law to predict the specific heats of gases theoretically.  
"Later we shall also discuss briefly, the application to specific heat of solids.  "
The molecule of a monatomic gas has only three translational degrees of freedom.  
"Thus, the average energy of a molecule at temperature T is  -LRB- 3/2 -RRB-  kBT.  "
"As explained earlier, a diatomic molecule treated as a rigid rotator like a dumbbell has 5 degrees of freedom: 3 translational and 2 rotational.  "
"In general a polyatomic molecule has 3 translational, 3 rotational degrees of freedom and a certain number  -LRB- f -RRB-  of vibrational modes.  "
"Since the volume of the cylinder is fixed, the heat required is determined by Cv.  "
We can use the law of equipartition of energy to determine specific heats of solids.  
"Consider a solid of N atoms, each vibrating about its mean position.  "
An oscillation in one dimension has energy is average energy of 2 × ½ kABT = kBT.  
"In three dimensions, the average energy is 3 kBT.  "
"Now at constant pressure ΔQ = ΔU + PΔV = ΔU, since for a solid ΔV is negligible.  "
As Table 13.3 shows the prediction generally agrees with experimental values at ordinary temperature  -LRB- Carbon is an exception -RRB- .  
We treat water like a solid.  
For each atom average energy is 3kBT.  
This is the value observed and the agreement is very good.  
"In the calorie, gram, degree units, water is defined to have unit specific heat.  "
"As 1 calorie = 4.179 joules and one mole of water is 18 grams, the heat capacity per mole is ~ 75 J mol-1 K-1 ~ 9R.  "
"However with more complex molecules like alcohol or acetone the arguments, based on degrees of freedom, become more complicated.  "
"Lastly, we should note an important aspect of the predictions of specific heats, based on the classical law of equipartition of energy.  "
The predicted specific heats are independent of temperature.  
"As expected, the mean free path given by Eq. -LRB- 13.40 -RRB-  depends inversely on the number density and the size of the molecules.  "
In a highly evacuated tube n is rather small and the mean free path can be as large as the length of the tube.  
The d for water vapor is same as that of air.  
The number density is inversely proportional to absolute temperature.  
Note that the mean free path is 100 times the interatomic distance ~ 40 Å = 4 × 10-9 m calculated earlier.  
It is this large value of mean free path that leads to the typical gaseous behavior.  
Gases can not be confined without a container.  
"Using, the kinetic theory of gases, the bulk measurable properties like viscosity, heat conductivity and diffusion can be related to the microscopic parameters like molecular size ; It is through such relations that the molecular sizes were first estimated.  "
In our daily life we come across various kinds of motions.  
"You have already learned about some of them, e.g. rectilinear motion and motion of a projectile.  "
Both these motions are non-repetitive.  
We have also learned about uniform circular motion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system.  
"In these cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of time, that is, it is periodic.  "
In your childhood you must have enjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing.  
Both these motions are repetitive in nature but different from the periodic motion of a planet.  
"Here, the object moves to and fro about a mean position.  "
Such a motion is termed as oscillatory motion.  
In this chapter we study this motion.  
The study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its concepts are required for the understanding of many physical phenomena.  
"In musical instruments like the sitar, the guitar or the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce pleasing sounds.  "
The membranes in drums and diaphragms in telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about their mean positions.  
The vibrations of air molecules make the propagation of sound possible.  
"Similarly, the atoms in a solid oscillate about their mean positions and convey the sensation of temperature.  "
"The oscillations of electrons in the antennas of radio, TV and satellite transmitters convey information.  "
"The description of a periodic motion in general, and oscillatory motion in particular, requires some fundamental concepts like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude and phase.  "
These concepts are developed in the next section.  
Fig 14.1 shows some periodic motions.  
Suppose an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down it comes back to the initial point and repeats the process identically.  
"If you draw a graph of its height above the ground versus time, it would look something like Fig. 14.1 -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
"If a child climbs up a step, comes down, and repeats the process, its height above the ground would look like that in Fig 14.1 -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
"When you play the game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between your palm and the ground, its height versus time graph would look like the one in Fig 14.1 -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
These are examples of periodic motion.  
"Thus, a motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion.  "
Very often the body undergoing periodic motion has an equilibrium position somewhere inside its path.  
"This motion arises when the force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement from the mean position, which is also the equilibrium position.  "
"Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force is directed towards the mean position.  "
"In practice, oscillating bodies eventually come to rest at their equilibrium positions, because of the damping due to friction and other dissipative causes.  "
"However, they can be forced to remain oscillating by means of some external periodic agency.  "
We discuss the phenomena of damped and forced oscillations later in the chapter.  
Any material medium can be pictured as a collection of a large number of coupled oscillators.  
The collective oscillations of the constituents of a medium manifest themselves as waves.  
"Examples of waves include water waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves.  "
We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next chapter.  
We have seen that any motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion.  
The smallest interval of time after which the motion is repeated is called its period.  
Let us denote the period by the symbol T.  
Its SI unit is second.  
"For periodic motions, which are either too fast or too slow on the scale of seconds, other convenient units of time are used.  "
The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal is expressed in units of microseconds  -LRB- 10—6 s -RRB-  abbreviated as µs.  
"On the other hand, the orbital period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days.  "
The Halley's comet appears after every 76 years.  
The reciprocal of T gives the number of repetitions that occur per unit time.  
This quantity is called the frequency of the periodic motion.  
It is represented by the symbol ν.  
The relation between v and T is v = 1/T ; The unit of ν is thus s—1.  
"After the discoverer of radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz  -LRB- 1857-1894 -RRB- , a special name has been given to the unit of frequency.  "
It is called hertz  -LRB- abbreviated as Hz -RRB- .  
"Thus, 1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s — 1.  "
"Note, that the frequency, ν, is not necessarily an integer.  "
The beat frequency of heart = 75/ -LRB- 1 min -RRB-  = 75/ -LRB- 60 s -RRB-  = 1.25 s—1 = 1.25 Hz.  
The time period T = 1/ -LRB- 1.25 s—1 -RRB-  = 0.8 s.  
"In section 4.2, we defined displacement of a particle as the change in its position vector.  "
"In this chapter, we use the term displacement in a more general sense.  "
It refers to change with time of any physical property under consideration.  
"For example, in case of rectilinear motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance from the starting point as a function of time is its position displacement.  "
The choice of origin is a matter of convenience.  
"Consider a block attached to a spring, the other end of which is fixed to a rigid wall  -LRB- see Fig.14.2 -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
Generally it is convenient to measure displacement of the body from its equilibrium position.  
"For an oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the vertical as a function of time may be regarded as a displacement variable  -LRB- see Fig.14.2 -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
The term displacement is not always to be referred θ from the vertical ; in the context of position only.  
There can be many other kinds of displacement variables.  
"The voltage across a capacitor, changing with time in an a.c. circuit, is also a displacement variable.  "
"In the same way, pressure variations in time in the propagation of sound wave, the changing electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are examples of displacement in different contexts.  "
The displacement variable may take both positive and negative values.  
"In experiments on oscillations, the displacement is measured for different times.  "
The displacement can be represented by a mathematical function of time.  
"In case of periodic motion, this function is periodic in time.  "
One of the simplest periodic functions is given by f -LRB- t -RRB-  = A cos ωt.  
"If the argument of this function, ωt, is increased by an integral multiple of 2π radians, the value of the function remains the same.  "
"The same result is obviously correct if we consider a sine function, f -LRB- t -RRB-  = A sin ωt.  "
The periodic time of the function is 2π/ω.  
This is an example of a periodic motion.  
It can be noted that each term represents a periodic function with a different angular frequency.  
"Therefore, the smallest interval of time after which the sum of the three terms repeats is T0, and thus the sum is 2π/ω.  "
"The function e—ωt is not periodic, it decreases monotonically with increasing time and tends to zero as t → ∞ and thus, never repeats its value.  "
The function log -LRB- ωt -RRB-  increases mono-tonically with time t.  
"It, therefore, never repeats its value and is a non-periodic function.  "
"It may be noted that as t → ∞, log -LRB- ωt -RRB-  diverges to ∞.  "
"It, therefore, can not represent any kind of physical displacement.  "
Let us consider a particle vibrating back and forth about the origin of an x-axis between the limits +A and –A as shown in Fig. 14.3.  
In between these extreme positions the particle moves in such a manner that its speed is maximum when it is at the origin and zero when it is at ± A.  
The time t is chosen to be zero when the particle is at + A and it returns to +A at t = T.  
In this section we will describe this motion.  
"Later, we shall discuss how to achieve it.  "
"To study the motion of this particle, we record its positions as a function of time by taking ‘snapshots’ at regular intervals of time.  "
A set of such snapshots is shown in Fig.14.4.  
The position of the particle with reference to the origin gives its displacement at any instant of time.  
For such a motion the displacement x -LRB- t -RRB-  of the particle from a certain chosen origin is found to vary with time.  
The speed is maximum when the particle is at the origin and zero when it is at ± A.  
It is represented by Eq. -LRB- 14.4 -RRB-  for φ = 0.  
The motion represented by Eq.  -LRB- 14.4 -RRB-  is called simple harmonic motion  -LRB- SHM -RRB- ; a term that means the periodic motion is a sinusoidal function of time.  
"Equation  -LRB- 14.4 -RRB- , in which the sinusoidal function is a cosine function, is plotted in Fig. 14.5.  "
The curves 1 and 2 are for two the shape of the graph are displayed in Fig. 14.6 along with their names.  
We shall now define these quantities.  
The quantity A is called the amplitude of the motion.  
It is a positive constant which represents the magnitude of the maximum displacement of the particle in either direction.  
"The cosine function in Eq.  -LRB- 14.4 -RRB-  varies between the limits ± 1, so the displacement x  -LRB- t -RRB-  varies between the limits ± A.  "
"In Fig. 14.7  -LRB- a -RRB- , the curves 1 and 2 are plots of Eq.  -LRB- 14.4 -RRB-  for two different amplitudes A and B.  "
The difference between these curves illustrates the significance of amplitude.  
"The time varying quantity,  -LRB- ωt+φ -RRB- , in Eq. -LRB- 14.4 -RRB-  is called the phase of the motion.  "
It describes the state of motion at a given time.  
The constant φ is called the phase constant  -LRB- or phase angle -RRB- .  
The value of φ depends on the displacement and velocity of the particle at t = 0.  
This can be understood better by considering Fig. 14.7  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
The function is periodic having a period T = π/ω.  
It also represents a harmonic motion with the point of equilibrium occurring at 1/2 instead of zero.  
"In 1610, Galileo discovered four principal moons of the planet Jupiter.  "
"To him, each moon seemed to move back and forth relative to the planet in a simple harmonic motion; the disc of the planet forming the mid point of the motion.  "
"The record of his observations, written in his own hand, is still available.  "
"Based on his data, the position of the moon Callisto relative to Jupiter is plotted in Fig.14.9.  "
"In this figure, the circles represent Galileo's data points and the curve drawn is a best fit to the data.  "
"The curve obeys Eq. -LRB- 14.4 -RRB- , which is the displacement function for SHM.  "
It gives a period of about 16.8 days.  
It is now well known that Callisto moves with essentially a constant speed in an almost circular orbit around Jupiter.  
Its true motion is uniform circular motion.  
"What Galileo saw and what we can also see, with a good pair of binoculars, is the projection of this uniform circular motion on a line in the plane of motion.  "
This can easily be visualised by performing a simple experiment.  
Tie a ball to the end of a string and make it move in a horizontal plane about a fixed point with a constant angular speed.  
The ball would then perform a uniform circular motion in the horizontal plane.  
"Observe the ball sideways or from the front, fixing your attention in the plane of motion.  "
The ball will appear to execute to and fro motion along a horizontal line with the point of rotation as the midpoint.  
You could alternatively observe the shadow of the ball on a wall which is perpendicular to the plane of the circle.  
In this process what we are observing is the motion of the ball on a diameter of the circle normal to the direction of viewing.  
This experiment provides an analogy to Galileo's observation.  
"In Fig.14.10, we show the motion of a reference particle P executing a uniform circular motion with  -LRB- constant -RRB-  angular speed ω in a reference circle.  "
The radius A of the circle is the magnitude of the particle's position vector.  
"At any time t, the angular position of the particle ω in a reference is ωt + φ, where φ is its angular position at t = 0.  "
"The projection of particle P on the x-axis is a point P′, which we can take as a second particle.  "
The projection of the position vector of particle P on the x-axis gives the location x -LRB- t -RRB-  of P′.  
"Thus we have, x -LRB- t -RRB-  = A cos  -LRB- ωt+φ -RRB-  which is the same as Eq. -LRB- 14.4 -RRB- .  "
"This shows that if the reference particle P moves in a uniform circular motion, its projection particle P′ executes a simple harmonic motion along a diameter of the circle.  "
"From Galileo’s observation and the above considerations, we are led to the conclusion that circular motion viewed edge-on is simple harmonic motion.  "
In a more formal language we can say that: Simple harmonic motion is the projection of uniform circular motion on a diameter of the circle in which the latter motion takes place.  
"In this case at t = 0, OP makes an angle of 90° = π/2π with the x-axis.  "
"The negative sign appears because the velocity component of P is directed towards the left, in the negative direction of x.  "
Equation -LRB- 14.9 -RRB-  expresses the instantaneous velocity of the particle P′  -LRB- projection of P -RRB- .  
"Therefore, it expresses the instantaneous velocity of a particle executing SHM.  "
We have seen that a particle executing a uniform circular motion is subjected to a radial acceleration a directed towards the center.  
"Figure 14.13 shows such a radial acceleration, a, of the reference particle P executing uniform circular motion.  "
"Equation -LRB- 14.11 -RRB- , therefore, represents the instantaneous acceleration of the particle P′, which is executing SHM.  "
Thus Eq. -LRB- 14.11 -RRB-  expresses the acceleration of a particle executing SHM.  
It is an important result for SHM.  
"It shows that in SHM, the acceleration is proportional to the displacement and is always directed towards the mean position.  "
"The inter-relationship between the displacement of a particle executing simple harmonic motion, its velocity and acceleration can be seen in Fig.14.14.  "
In this figure  -LRB- a -RRB-  is a plot of Eq.  -LRB- 14.4 -RRB-  with φ = 0 and  -LRB- b -RRB-  depicts Eq.  -LRB- 14.9 -RRB-  also with φ = 0.  
"Similar to the amplitude A in Eq.  -LRB- 14.4 -RRB- , the positive quantity ωA in Eq.  -LRB- 14.9 -RRB-  is called the velocity amplitude vm.  "
Figure 14.14 -LRB- c -RRB-  depicts the variation of the particle acceleration a -LRB- t -RRB- .  
"It is seen that when the displacement has its greatest positive value, the acceleration has its greatest negative value and vice versa.  "
"When the displacement is zero, the acceleration is also zero.  "
"In Section 14.3, we described the simple harmonic motion.  "
Now we discuss how it can be generated.  
Newton's second law of motion relates the force acting on a system and the corresponding acceleration produced.  
Equation  -LRB- 14.13 -RRB-  gives the force acting on the particle.  
It is proportional to the displacement and directed in an opposite direction.  
"Therefore, it is a restoring force.  "
"Note that unlike the centripetal force for uniform circular motion that is constant in magnitude, the restoring force for SHM is time dependent.  "
The force law expressed by Eq.  -LRB- 14.13 -RRB-  can be taken as an alternative definition of simple harmonic motion.  
"It states: Simple harmonic motion is the motion executed by a particle subject to a force, which is proportional to the displacement of the particle and is directed towards the mean position.  "
"Since the force F is proportional to x rather than to some other power of x, such a system is also referred to as a linear harmonic oscillator.  "
Systems in which the restoring force is a non- linear function of x are termed as non-linear harmonic or anharmonic oscillators.  
"Let the mass be displaced by a small distance x to the right side of the equilibrium position, as shown in Fig. 14.16.  "
Under this situation the spring on the left side gets elongated by a length equal to x and that on the right side gets compressed by the same length.  
"The forces acting on the mass are then, F1 = –kx  -LRB- force exerted by the spring on the left side, trying to pull the mass towards the mean position -RRB- .  "
"F2 = –kx  -LRB- force exerted by the spring on the right side, trying to push the mass towards the mean position -RRB-   "
"Hence the force acting on the mass is proportional to the displacement and is directed towards the mean position; therefore, the motion executed by the mass is simple harmonic.  "
"A particle executing simple harmonic motion has kinetic and potential energies, both varying between the limits, zero and maximum.  "
"In section 14.5 we have seen that the velocity of a particle executing SHM, is a periodic function of time.  "
It is zero at the extreme positions of displacement.  
"Note, since the sign of v is immaterial in K, the period of K is T/2.  "
What is the potential energy  -LRB- PE -RRB-  of a particle executing simple harmonic motion?  
"In Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of potential energy is possible only for conservative forces.   "
"Thus the potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is also periodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean position and maximum at the extreme displacements.  "
The total mechanical energy of a harmonic oscillator is thus independent of time as expected for motion under any conservative force.  
The time and displacement dependence of the potential and kinetic energies of a linear simple harmonic oscillator are shown in Fig.14.17.  
"It is observed that in a linear harmonic oscillator, all energies are positive and peak twice during every period.  "
"For x = 0, the energy is all kinetic and for x = ±A it is all potential.  "
"In between these extreme positions, the potential energy increases at the expense of kinetic energy.  "
This behaviour of a linear harmonic oscillator suggests that it possesses an element of springiness and an element of inertia.  
The former stores its potential energy and the latter stores its kinetic energy.  
"We also know that at maximum displacement, K.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the system is equal to the P.E.  "
This is in conformity with the principle of conservation of energy.  
"In the subsequent part of this section, we discuss the motion executed by some such systems.  "
The block is placed on a frictionless horizontal surface.  
"If the block is pulled on one side and is released, it then executes a to and fro motion about a mean position.  "
"Let x = 0, indicate the position of the center of the block when the spring is in equilibrium.  "
The positions marked as —A and +A indicate the maximum displacements to the left and the right of the mean position.  
"We have already learned that springs have special properties, which were first discovered by the English physicist Robert Hooke.  "
"He had shown that such a system when deformed, is subject to a restoring force, the magnitude of which is proportional to the deformation or the displacement and acts in opposite direction.  "
This is known as Hooke's law  -LRB- Chapter 9 -RRB- .  
It holds good for displacements small in comparison to the length of the spring.  
"At any time t, if the displacement of the block from its mean position is x, the restoring force F acting on the block is, F -LRB- x -RRB-  = —kx.  "
"The constant of proportionality, k, is called the spring constant, its value is governed by the elastic properties of the spring.  "
A stiff spring has large k and a soft spring has small k.  
Equation -LRB- 14.19 -RRB-  is same as the force law for SHM and therefore the system executes a simple harmonic motion.  
It is said that Galileo measured the periods of a swinging chandelier in a church by his pulse beats.  
He observed that the motion of the chandelier was periodic.  
The system is a kind of pendulum.  
"You can also make your own pendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long unstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm long.  "
Suspend your pendulum from a suitable support so that it is free to oscillate.  
Displace the stone to one side by a small distance and let it go.  
"The stone executes a to and fro motion, it is periodic with a period of about two seconds.  "
Is this motion simple harmonic?  
"The bob is free to swing to and fro in the plane of the page, to the left and right of a vertical line through the pivot point.  "
"The forces acting on the bob are the force T, tension in the string and the gravitational force Fg  -LRB- = mg -RRB- , as shown in Fig. 14.19 -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
The string makes an angle θ with the vertical.  
We resolve the force Fg into a radial component Fg cos θ and a tangential component Fg sin θ.  
The tangential component produces a restoring torque about the pendulum’s pivot point.  
This torque always acts opposite to the displacement of the bob so as to bring it back towards its central location.  
"The central location is called the equilibrium position  -LRB- θ = 0 -RRB- , because at this position the pendulum would be at rest if it were not swinging.  "
"Thus as the pendulum moves to the right, its pull to the left increases until it stops and begins to return to the left.  "
Thus the motion of a simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately SHM.  
"We know that the motion of a simple pendulum, swinging in air, dies out eventually.  "
Why does it happen?  
This is because the air drag and the friction at the support oppose the motion of the pendulum and dissipate its energy gradually.  
The pendulum is said to execute damped oscillations.  
"In damped oscillations, although the energy of the system is continuously dissipated, the oscillations remain apparently periodic.  "
The dissipating forces are generally the frictional forces.  
"To understand the effect of such external forces on the motion of an oscillator, let us consider a system as shown in Fig. 14.20.  "
Here a block of mass m oscillates vertically on a spring with spring constant k.  
The block is connected to a vane through a rod  -LRB- the vane and the rod are considered to be massless -RRB- .  
"This position, shown by O in Fig 14.20, is the equilibrium position of the mass.  "
"If the mass is pulled down or pushed up a little, the restoring force on the block due to the spring is FS = —kx, where x is equilibrium position.  "
Here we have dropped the vector notation because we are discussing one-dimensional motion.  
The solution of Eq. -LRB- 14.32 -RRB-  describes the motion of the block under the influence of a damping force which is proportional to velocity.  
"In this function, the cosine function has a period 2π/ω′ but the function x -LRB- t -RRB-  is not strictly periodic because of the factor e—bt/2m which decreases continuously with time.  "
"However, if the decrease is small in one time period T, the motion represented by Eq. -LRB- 14.33 -RRB-  is approximately periodic.  "
"The solution, Eq. -LRB- 14.33 -RRB- , can be graphically represented as shown in Fig. 14.21.  "
"We can regard it as a cosine function whose amplitude, which is Ae—bt/2m, gradually decreases with time.  "
We have seen that the mechanical energy of an undamped oscillator is constant and is given by Eq.  -LRB- 14.18 -RRB-   -LRB- E = 1/2kA2 -RRB- .  
"If the oscillator is damped, the mechanical energy is not constant but decreases with time.  "
"If the damping is small, we can find E -LRB- t -RRB-  by replacing A in Eq.  -LRB- 14.18 -RRB-  by Ae—bt/2m, the amplitude of the damped oscillations.  "
Equation  -LRB- 14.35 -RRB-  shows that the total energy of the system decreases exponentially with time.  
Note that small damping means that the dimensionless ratio is much less than 1.  
"For calculating the time, t1/2, for its mechanical energy to drop to half its initial value we make use of Eq.  -LRB- 14.35 -RRB- .  "
Suppose an external force F -LRB- t -RRB-  of amplitude F0 that varies periodically with time is applied to a damped oscillator.  
This is the equation of an oscillator of mass m on which a periodic force of  -LRB- angular -RRB-  frequency ωd is applied.  
"Its displacement, after the natural oscillations die out, is given by x -LRB- t -RRB-  = A cos  -LRB- ωdt + φ -RRB- , where t is the time measured from the moment when we apply the periodic force.  "
Equation  -LRB- 14.39 -RRB-  shows that the amplitude of the forced oscillator depends on the  -LRB- angular -RRB-  frequency of the driving force.  
We can see a different behavior of the oscillator when ωd is far from ω and when it is close to ω.  
We consider these two cases.  
Figure 14.22 shows the dependence of the displacement amplitude of an oscillator on the angular frequency of the driving force for different amounts of damping present in the system.  
It may be noted that in all the cases the amplitude is greatest when ωd/ω = 1.  
The curves the taller and narrower is the resonance peak.  
"If we go on changing the driving frequency, the amplitude tends to infinity when it equals the natural frequency.  "
"But this is the ideal case of zero damping, a case which never arises in a real system as the damping is never perfectly zero.  "
"This amplitude is large, but not infinity, because there is always some damping in your swing.  "
This will become clear in the  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
"Curve a corresponds to the least damping, and damping goes on increasing successively in curves b, c, d, e.  "
Notice that the peak shifts to the left with increasing b.  
"This makes it clear that the maximum possible amplitude for a given driving frequency is governed by the driving frequency and the damping, and is never infinity.  "
The phenomenon of increase in amplitude when the driving force is close to the natural frequency of the oscillator is called resonance.  
In our daily life we encounter phenomena which involve resonance.  
Your experience with swings is a good example of resonance.  
You might have realized that the skill in swinging to greater heights lies in the synchronisation of the rhythm of pushing against the ground with the natural frequency of the swing.  
"To illustrate this point further, let us consider a set of five simple pendulums of assorted lengths suspended from a common rope as shown in Fig. 14.23.  "
The pendulums 1 and 4 have the same lengths and the others have different lengths.  
Now let us set pendulum 1 into motion.  
The energy from this pendulum gets transferred to other pendulums through the connecting rope and they start oscillating.  
The driving force is provided through the connecting rope.  
The frequency of this force is the frequency with which pendulum 1 oscillates.  
"Their frequencies of oscillation gradually change and ultimately they oscillate with the frequency of pendulum 1, i.e. the frequency of the driving force but with different amplitudes.  "
They oscillate with small amplitudes ; The response of pendulum 4 is in contrast to this set of pendulums.  
It oscillates with the same frequency as that of pendulum 1 and its amplitude gradually picks up and becomes very large.  
A resonance-like response is seen.  
"This happens because in this the condition for resonance is satisfied, i.e. the natural frequency of the system coincides with that of the driving force.  "
"The Tacoma Narrows Bridge at Puget Sound, Washington, USA was opened on July 1, 1940.  "
Four months later winds produced a pulsating resultant force in resonance with the natural frequency of the structure.  
This caused a steady increase in the amplitude of oscillations until the bridge collapsed.  
It is for the same reason the marching soldiers break steps while crossing a bridge.  
Aircraft designers make sure that none of the natural frequencies at which a wing can oscillate match the frequency of the engines in flight.  
Earthquakes cause vast devastation.  
"It is interesting to note that sometimes, in an earthquake, short and tall structures remain unaffected while the medium height structures fall down.  "
This happens because the natural frequencies of the short structures happen to be higher and those of taller structures lower than the frequency of the seismic waves.  
"In the previous Chapter, we studied the motion of objects oscillating in isolation.  "
"What happens in a system, which is a collection of such objects?  "
A material medium provides such an example.  
"Here, elastic forces bind the constituents to each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of the other.  "
"If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water, the water surface gets disturbed.  "
"The disturbance does not remain confined to one place, but propagates outward along a circle.  "
It gives a feeling as if the water is moving outward from the point of disturbance.  
"This shows that the water mass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a moving disturbance is created.  "
"Similarly, when we speak, the sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air from one part of the medium to another.  "
The disturbances produced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or a microphone can detect them.  
"These patterns, which move without the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a whole, are called waves.  "
"In this Chapter, we will study such waves.  "
"In a wave, information and energy, in the form of signals, propagate from one point to another but no material object makes the journey.  "
All our communications depend on the transmission of signals through waves.  
"When we make a telephone call to a friend at a distant place, a sound wave carries the message from our vocal cords to the telephone.  "
"At the receiving end, the electrical or light signal or the electromagnetic waves are transformed back into sound waves traveling from the telephone to the ear.  "
Not all waves require a medium for their propagation.  
We know that light waves can travel through vacuum.  
"The light emitted by stars, which are hundreds of light years away, reaches us through inter-stellar space, which is practically a vacuum.  "
"The waves we come across are mainly of three types:  -LRB- a -RRB-  mechanical waves,  -LRB- b -RRB-  electromagnetic waves and  -LRB- c -RRB-  matter waves.  "
"Mechanical waves are most familiar because we encounter them constantly; common examples include water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, etc..  "
"All these waves have certain central features: They are governed by Newton's laws, and can exist only within a material medium, such as water, air, and rock.  "
"The common examples of electromagnetic waves are visible and ultra-violet light, radio waves, microwaves, x-rays etc..  "
"All electromagnetic waves travel through vacuum at the same speed c, given by c = 299, 792,458 ms—1  -LRB- speed of light -RRB- .  "
"Unlike the mechanical waves, the electro-magnetic waves do not require any medium for their propagation.  "
You would learn more about these waves later.  
"Matter waves are associated with moving electrons, protons, neutrons and other fundamental particles, and even atoms and molecules.  "
"Because we commonly think of these as constituting matter, such waves are called matter waves.  "
They arise in quantum mechanical description of nature that you will learn in your later studies.  
"In this chapter we will study mechanical waves, which require a material medium for their propagation.  "
The aesthetic influence of waves on art and literature is seen from very early times; yet the first scientific analysis of wave motion dates back to the seventeenth century.  
"Some of the famous scientists associated with the physics of wave motion are Christiaan Huygens  -LRB- 1629-1695 -RRB- , Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton.  "
The understanding of physics of waves followed the physics of oscillations of masses tied to springs and physics of the simple pendulum.  
Waves in elastic media are intimately connected with harmonic oscillations.  
"Stretched strings, coiled springs, air, etc., are examples of elastic media.  "
We shall illustrate this connection through simple examples.  
Consider a collection of springs connected to one another as shown in Fig.15.1.  
"If the spring at one end is pulled suddenly and released, the disturbance travels to the other end.  "
What has happened?  
The first spring is disturbed from its equilibrium length.  
"Since the second spring is connected to the first, it is also stretched or compressed, and so on.  "
The disturbance moves from one end to the other; but each spring only executes small oscillations about its equilibrium position.  
"As a practical example of this situation, consider a stationary train at a railway station.  "
Different bogies of the train are coupled to each other through a spring coupling.  
Now let us consider the propagation of sound waves in air.  
"As the wave passes through air, it compresses or expands a small region of air.  "
"This causes a change in the density of that region, say δρ, this change induces a change in pressure, δp, in that region.  "
"Pressure is force per unit area, so there is a restoring force proportional to the disturbance, just like in a spring.  "
"In this case, the quantity similar to extension or compression of the spring is the change in density.  "
"If a region is compressed, the molecules in that region are packed together, and they tend to move out to the adjoining region, thereby increasing the density or creating compression in the adjoining region.  "
If a region is comparatively rarefied the surrounding air will rush in making the rarefaction move to the adjoining region.  
"Thus, the compression or rarefaction moves from one region to another, making the propagation of a disturbance possible in air.  "
"In solids, similar arguments can be made.  "
"In a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice.  "
"In these, each atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to forces from the surrounding atoms.  "
"So we can think of atoms in a lattice as end points, with springs between pairs of them.  "
In the subsequent sections of this chapter we are going to discuss various characteristic properties of waves.  
Mechanical waves can be transverse or longitudinal depending on the relationship between the directions of disturbance or displacement in the medium and that of the propagation of wave.  
To differentiate between them let us consider the response of a stretched string fixed at one end.  
"If you give a single up-and-down jerk to the free end of this string, as shown in Fig. 15.2, a wave in the form of a single pulse travels along the string.  "
The formation and propagation of this pulse is possible because the string is under tension.  
In the meanwhile you have pulled down your end of the string.  
The net result is that a distortion in the shape of the string  -LRB- the pulse -RRB-  moves along the string with a certain velocity v.  
"If you move your end up and down in a continuous manner, a continuous wave travels along the string with a velocity v.  "
"However, if the motion of your hand is a sinusoidal function of time, at any given instant of time the wave will have a sinusoidal shape as shown in Fig. 15.3.  "
The wave has the shape of a sine or cosine curve.  
The waves shown in Fig. 15.3 can be studied in two ways.  
"Oneway is to monitor the waveforms as they move to the right, i.e. take a 'snapshot' of the string at a given instant of time.  "
We would find that the displacement of every such oscillating string element is transverse  -LRB- i.e. perpendicular -RRB-  to the direction of travel of the wave as indicated in Fig. 15.3.  
Such a wave is said to be a transverse wave.  
"Now, let us consider the production of waves in a long air-filled pipe by the movement of a piston as shown in Fig. 15.4.  "
"If you suddenly move the piston to the right and then to the left, you are sending a pulse of pressure along the pipe.  "
"The motion of the piston to the right pushes the elements of air next towards the right, changing the air pressure there.  "
The increased pressure in this region then pushes on the elements of air somewhat farther along the pipe.  
Moving the piston to the left reduces the air pressure next to it.  
This causes the elements of air next to it move back to the left and then the farther elements follow.  
"Thus, the motion of the air and the change in air pressure travel towards the right along the pipe as a pulse.  "
"If you push and pull on the piston in a simple harmonic manner, a sinusoidal wave travels along the pipe.  "
It may be noted that the motion of the elements of air is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave.  
"This motion is said to be longitudinal and the wave produced is, therefore, called a longitudinal wave.  "
The sound waves produced in air are such pressure waves and are therefore of longitudinal character.  
"In short, in transverse waves, the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and in longitudinal waves they oscillate along the direction of wave propagation.  "
"A wave, transverse or longitudinal, is said to be traveling or progressive if it travels from one point of the medium to another.  "
A progressive wave is to be distinguished from a standing or stationary wave  -LRB- see Section 15.7 -RRB- .  
In Fig. 15.3 transverse waves travel from one end of the string to the other end while the longitudinal waves in Fig. 15.4 travel from one end of the pipe to its other end.  
"We note again that in both the cases, it is the wave or the disturbance that moves from end to end, not the material through which the waves propagate.  "
"In transverse waves, the particle motion is normal to the direction of propagation of the wave.  "
"Therefore, as the wave propagates, each element of the medium undergoes a shearing strain.  "
"Transverse waves can, therefore, be propagated only in those media which can sustain shearing stress, such as solids and strings, and not in fluids.  "
"Fluids as well as solids can sustain compressive strain; therefore, longitudinal waves can propagate in all elastic media.  "
"For example, in medium like a steel bar, both transverse and longitudinal waves can propagate while air can sustain only longitudinal waves.  "
The waves on the surface of water are of two kinds: capillary waves and gravity waves.  
The former are ripples of fairly short wavelength — no more than a few centimetres — and the restoring force that produces them is the surface tension of water.  
Gravity waves have wavelengths typically ranging from several metres to several hundred metres.  
"The restoring force that produces these waves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep the water surface at its lowest level.  "
"The oscillations of the particles in these waves are not confined to the surface only, but extend with diminishing amplitude to the very bottom.  "
The particle motion in the water waves involves a complicated motion; they not only move up and down but also back and forth.  
The waves in an ocean are a combination of both longitudinal and transverse waves.  
It is found that generally transverse and longitudinal waves travel with different speeds in the same medium.  
"A point of maximum positive displacement in a wave, shown by the arrow, is called crest, and a point of maximum negative displacement is called trough.  "
The progress of the wave is indicated by the progress of the short arrow pointing to a crest of the wave towards the right.  
"As we move from one plot to another, the short arrow moves to the right with the wave shape, but the string moves only parallel to y-axis.  "
"It can be seen that as we go from plot  -LRB- a -RRB-  to  -LRB- e -RRB- , a particular element of the string has undergone one complete cycle of changes or completed one full oscillation.  "
During this course of time the short arrow head or the wave has moved by a characteristic distance along the x-axis.  
"In the context of the above five plots, we will now define various quantities in Eq.  -LRB- 15.2 -RRB-  and shown in Fig.15.5.  "
The amplitude a of a wave such as that in Figs.15.5 and 15.6 is the magnitude of the maximum displacement of the elements from their equilibrium positions as the wave passes through them.  
It is depicted in Fig.15.6 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"Since am is a magnitude, it is a positive quantity, even if the displacement is negative.  "
The phase of the wave is the argument  -LRB- kx — ωt + φ -RRB-  of the oscillatory term sin  -LRB- kx — ωt + φ -RRB-  in Eq.  -LRB- 15.2 -RRB- .  
It describes the state of motion as the wave sweeps through a string element at a particular position x ; It changes linearly with time t.  
"The sine function also changes with time, oscillating between +1 and — 1.  "
Its extreme positive value +1 corresponds to a peak of the wave moving through the element; then the value of y at position x is a.  
"Its extreme negative value —1 corresponds to a valley of the wave moving through the element, then the value of y at position x is —a.  "
The constant φ is called the initial phase angle.  
"The value of φ is determined by the initial  -LRB- t = 0 -RRB-  displacement and velocity of the element  -LRB- say, at x = 0 -RRB- .  "
It is always possible to choose origin  -LRB- x = 0 -RRB-  and the initial instant  -LRB- t = 0 -RRB-  such that φ = 0.  
There is no loss of generality in working with Eq. -LRB- 15.2 -RRB-  with φ = 0.  
The wavelength λ of a wave is the distance  -LRB- parallel to the direction of wave propagation -RRB-  between the consecutive repetitions of the shape of the wave.  
"A typical wavelength is marked in Fig.15.6 -LRB- a -RRB- , which is a plot of Eq. -LRB- 15.2 -RRB-  for t = 0 and φ = 0.  "
k is called the propagation constant or the angular wave number ; its SI unit is radian per metre or rad m–1.  
"It may be noted that in Fig. 15.6, as we move from one plot to another, the wave moves to the right by a distance equal to 1/4λ.  "
"Thus, by the fifth plot, it has moved to the right by a distance equal to λ.  "
"If you were to monitor the string, you would see that the arbitrary time t1 is also indicated.  "
The period of oscillation T of a wave is defined as the time any string element takes to move through one complete oscillation.  
A typical period is marked on the Fig. 15.7.  
"ω is called the angular frequency of the wave, its SI unit is rad s—1.  "
Look back at the five plots of a traveling wave in Fig. 15.6.  
The time between two consecutive plots is T/4.  
"Thus, by the fifth plot, every string element has made one full oscillation.  "
It is the number of oscillations per unit time made by a string element as the wave passes through it.  
It is usually measured in hertz.  
"In the discussion above, reference has always been made to a wave traveling along a string or a transverse wave.  "
"In a longitudinal wave, the displacement of an element of the medium is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave.  "
"s -LRB- x,t -RRB-  is the displacement of an element of the medium in the direction of propagation of the wave at position x and time t.  "
"In Eq.  -LRB- 15.9 -RRB- , a is the displacement amplitude; other of a transverse wave except that the displacement function y -LRB- x,t -RRB-  is to be replaced by the function s -LRB- x,t -RRB- .  "
Let us monitor the propagation of a traveling wave represented by Eq. -LRB- 15.2 -RRB-  along a string.  
The wave is traveling in the positive direction of x.  
We find that an element of string at a particular position x moves up and down as a function of time but the waveform advances to the right.  
It is observed that during this interval of time the entire wave pattern moves by a distance Δx in the positive direction of x.  
"Thus the wave is traveling to the right, in the positive direction of x.  "
"If a wave is to travel in a medium like air, water, steel, or a stretched string, it must cause the particles of that medium to oscillate as it passes through it.  "
"For this to happen, the medium must possess mass and elasticity.  "
"Therefore the linear mass density  -LRB- or mass per unit length, in case of linear systems like a stretched string -RRB-  and the elastic properties determine how fast the wave can travel in the medium.  "
"Conversely, it should be possible to calculate the speed of the wave through the medium in terms of these properties.  "
"In subsequent sub-sections of this chapter, we will obtain specific expressions for the speed of mechanical waves in some media.  "
"However, we take recourse to a simpler procedure.  "
"In dimensional analysis, we have already learned  -LRB- Chapter 2 -RRB-  how to get a relationship between different quantities which are interrelated.  "
"Such a relation is, however, uncertain to the extent of a constant factor.  "
The speed of a wave along a stretched ideal string depends only on the tension and the linear mass density of the string and does not depend on the frequency of the wave.  
In a longitudinal wave the constituents of the medium oscillate forward and backward in the direction of propagation of the wave.  
We have already seen that the sound waves travel in the form of compressions and rarefactions of small volume elements of air.  
"The property that determines the extent to which the volume of an element of a medium changes when the pressure on it changes, is the bulk modulus B  "
Here ΔV/V is the fractional change in volume produced by a change in pressure ΔP.  
The SI unit for pressure is Nm—2 or pascal  -LRB- Pa -RRB- .  
The dimension of density is  -LRB- ML—3 -RRB- .  
C is a dimensionless constant and can be shown to be unity.  
The speed of propagation of a longitudinal wave in a fluid therefore depends only on the bulk modulus and the density of the medium.  
"When a solid bar is struck a blow at one end, the situation is somewhat different from that of a fluid confined in a tube or cylinder of constant cross section.  "
"For this case, the relevant modulus of elasticity is the Young's modulus, since the sideway expansion of the bar is negligible and only longitudinal strain needs to be considered.  "
"It can be shown that the speed of a longitudinal wave in the bar is given by, ρ Y v = ρ  -LRB- 15.20 -RRB-  where Y is the Young's modulus of the material of the bar.  "
Table 15.1 gives the speed of sound in various media.  
"It may be noted that although the densities of liquids and solids are much higher than those of the gases, the speed of sound in them is higher.  "
"It is because liquids and solids are less compressible than gases, i.e. have much greater bulk modulus.  "
This relation was first given by Newton and is known as Newton's formula.  
We know that 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 litres at STP.  
The result shown in Eq. -LRB- 15.23 -RRB-  is about 15% smaller as compared to the experimental value of 331 ms—1 as given in Table 15.1.  
Where did we go wrong?  
"These variations, therefore, are adiabatic and not isothermal.  "
"Thus for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk modulus is given by, Bad = γP where γ is the ratio of two specific heats, Cp/Cv.  "
This modification of Newton's formula is referred to as the Laplace correction.  
Let us consider that two waves are traveling simultaneously along the same stretched string in opposite directions.  
The sequence of pictures shown in Fig. 15.9 depicts the state of displacement of various elements of the string at different time instant.  
Each picture depicts the resultant waveform in the string at a given instant of time.  
It is observed that the net displacement of any element of the string at a given time is the algebraic sum of the displacements due to each wave.  
This way of addition of individual waveforms to determine the net waveform is called the principle of superposition.  
When the two disturbances overlap they give a complicated pattern as shown in  -LRB- c -RRB- .  
In region  -LRB- d -RRB-  they have passed each other and proceed unchanged.  
The principle of superposition can also be expressed by stating that overlapping waves algebraically add to produce a resultant wave  -LRB- or a net wave -RRB- .  
"The principle implies that the overlapping waves do not, in any way, alter the travel of each other.  "
If we have two or more waves moving in the medium the resultant waveform is the sum of wave functions of individual waves.  
As illustrative examples of this principle we shall study the phenomena of interference and reflection of waves.  
"Both the waves have the same angular frequency, same angular wave number k  -LRB- same wavelength -RRB-  and the same amplitude a.  "
"They travel in the positive direction of x-axis, with the same speed.  "
Their phases at a given distance and time differ by a constant angle φ.  
These waves are said to be out of phase by φ or have a phase difference φ.  
"Equation -LRB- 15.31 -RRB-  shows that the resultant wave is also a sinusoidal wave, traveling in the positive direction of x-axis.  "
"The amplitude of the resultant wave is 2am, which is the largest possible value of A -LRB- φ -RRB- .  "
"If φ = π  -LRB- 180° -RRB- , the two waves are completely out of phase, the amplitude of the resultant wave given by Eq. -LRB- 15.32 -RRB-  reduces to zero.  "
"We then have for all x and t, y -LRB- x,t -RRB-  = 0, These cases are shown in Fig. 15.10.  "
In previous sections we have discussed wave propagation in unbounded media.  
What happens when a pulse or a traveling wave encounters a rigid boundary?  
It is a common experience that under such a situation the pulse or the wave gets reflected.  
An everyday example of the reflection of sound waves from a rigid boundary is the phenomenon of echo.  
"If the boundary is not completely rigid or is an interface between two different elastic media, the effect of boundary conditions on an incident pulse or a wave is somewhat complicated.  "
A part of the wave is reflected and a part is transmitted into the second medium.  
If a wave is incident obliquely on the boundary between two different media the transmitted wave is called the refracted wave.  
"The incident and refracted waves obey Snell's law of refraction, and the incident and reflected waves obey the usual laws of reflection.  "
"To illustrate the reflection of waves at a boundary, we consider two situations.  "
"First, a string is fixed to a rigid wall at its left end, as shown in Fig. 15.11  -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
"In Fig. 15.11 -LRB- a -RRB- , the string is fixed to the wall at its left end.  "
"When the pulse arrives at that end, it exerts an upward force on the wall.  "
"By Newton's third law, the wall exerts an opposite force of equal magnitude on the string.  "
"This second force generates a pulse at the support  -LRB- the wall -RRB- , which travels back along the string in the direction opposite to that of the incident pulse.  "
"In a reflection of this kind, there must be no displacement at the support as the string is fixed there.  "
"The reflected and incident pulses must have opposite signs, so as to cancel each other at that point.  "
"Thus, in case of a traveling wave, the reflection at a rigid boundary will take place with a phase reversal or with a phase difference of π or 180°.  "
"In Fig. 15.11 -LRB- b -RRB- , the string is fastened to a ring, which slides without friction on a rod.  "
"In this case, when the pulse arrives at the left end, the ring moves up the rod.  "
"As the ring moves, it pulls on the string, stretching the string and producing a reflected pulse with the same sign and amplitude as the incident pulse.  "
"Thus, in such a reflection, the incident and reflected pulses reinforce each other, creating the maximum displacement at the end of the string: the maximum displacement of the ring is twice the amplitude of either of the pulses.  "
"Thus, the reflection is without any additional phase shift.  "
"In case of a traveling wave the reflection at an open boundary, such as the open end of an organ pipe, the reflection takes place without any phase change.  "
In the previous section we have considered a system which is bounded at one end.  
Let us now consider a system which is bounded at both the ends such as a stretched string fixed at the ends or an air column of finite length.  
It is seen that the points of maximum or minimum amplitude stay at one position.  
The positions of zero amplitude are called nodes.  
Note that a distance of λ/2 or half a wavelength separates two consecutive nodes.  
The antinodes are separated by λ / 2 and are located half way between pairs of nodes.  
"For a stretched string of length L, fixed at both ends, the two ends of the string have to be nodes.  "
"If one of the ends is chosen as position x = 0, then the other end is x = L.  "
The set of frequencies given by Eq. -LRB- 15.42 -RRB-  are called the natural frequencies or modes of oscillation of the system.  
"This equation tells us that the natural frequencies of a string are integral multiples of the lowest frequency v = v/2L, which corresponds to n = 1.  "
The oscillation mode with that lowest frequency is called the fundamental mode or the first harmonic.  
The second harmonic is the oscillation mode with n = 2.  
The third harmonic corresponds to n = 3 and so on.  
"The frequencies associated with these modes are often labeled as v1, v2, v3 and so on.  "
The collection of all and n is called the harmonic number.  
Some of the harmonics of a stretched string fixed at both the ends are shown in Fig. 15.13.  
"According to the principle of superposition, a stretched string tied at both ends can vibrate simultaneously in more than one modes.  "
Which mode is strongly excited depends on where the string is plucked or bowed.  
Musical instruments like sitar and violin are designed on this principle.  
"We now study the modes of vibration of a system closed at one end, with the other end being free.  "
Air columns such as glass tubes partially filled with water provide examples of such systems.  
"In these, the length of the air column can be adjusted by changing the water level in the tube.  "
"In such systems, the end of the air column in touch with the water suffers no displacement as the reflected and incident waves are exactly out of phase.  "
"On the other hand, at the open end, there is maximum displacement and minimum pressure change.  "
"The two waves traveling in opposite directions are in phase here, so there are no pressure changes.  "
Some of the normal modes in an air column with the open end are shown in Fig. 15.14.  
"In the case of a pipe open at both ends, there will be antinodes at both ends, and all harmonics will be generated.  "
Estimation of the frequencies of normal modes of this system is more complex.  
This problem involves wave propagation in two dimensions.  
"However, the underlying physics is the same.  "
"Clearly, a source of frequency 1.1 kHz will resonate at v2, i.e. the second harmonic.  "
"For L = 30 cm and v = 330 ms-1, the fundamental frequency of the pipe closed at one end is 275 Hz and the source frequency corresponds to its fourth harmonic.  "
"Since this harmonic is not a possible mode, no resonance will be observed with the source, the moment one end is closed.  "
"If we listen, a few minutes apart, two sounds of very close frequencies, say 256 Hz and 260 Hz, we will not be able to discriminate between them.  "
"However, if both these sounds reach our ears simultaneously, what we hear is a sound of frequency 258 Hz, the average of the two combining frequencies.  "
"The phenomenon of wavering of sound intensity when two waves of nearly same frequencies and amplitudes traveling in the same direction, are superimposed on each other is called beats.  "
Let us find out what happens when two waves having slightly different frequencies are superposed on each other.  
Let the time dependent variations of the displacements due to two sound waves at a particular location be s1 = acos ω1t and s2 = acos ω2t.  
"We have assumed, for simplicity that the waves have same amplitude and phase.  "
"The quantity in the brackets can be regarded as the amplitude of this function  -LRB- which is not a constant but, has a small variation of angular frequency ωb -RRB- .  "
"It becomes maximum whenever cos ωbt has the value +1 or —1, which happens twice in each repetition of cosine function.  "
"Since, ω1 and ω2 are very close, ωa can not be differentiated easily from either of them.  "
"Thus, the result of superposition of two waves having nearly the same frequencies is a wave with nearly same angular frequency but its amplitude is not constant.  "
Thus the intensity of resultant sound varies with an angular frequency ωbeat = 2ω = ω1 – ω2.  
Thus we hear a waxing and waning of sound with a frequency equal to the difference between the frequencies of the superposing waves.  
The time-displacement graphs of two waves of frequency 11 Hz and 9 Hz is shown in Figs. 15.16 -LRB- a -RRB-  and 15.16 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
The result of their 'superposition' is shown in Fig. 15.16 -LRB- c -RRB- .  
Musicians use the beat phenomenon in tuning their instruments.  
It is an everyday experience that the pitch  -LRB- or frequency -RRB-  of the whistle of a fast moving train decreases as it recedes away.  
"When we approach a stationary source of sound with high speed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to be higher than that of the source.  "
"As the observer recedes away from the source, the observed pitch  -LRB- or frequency -RRB-  becomes lower than that of the source.  "
This motion-related frequency change is called Doppler effect.  
The Austrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler first proposed the effect in 1842.  
Buys Ballot in Holland tested it experimentally in 1845.  
"Doppler effect is a wave phenomenon, it holds not only for sound waves but also for electromagnetic waves.  "
"However, here we shall consider only sound waves.  "
The situations  -LRB- 1 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 2 -RRB-  differ from each other because of the absence or presence of relative motion between the observer and the medium.  
"Most waves require a medium for their propagation; however, electromagnetic waves do not require any medium for propagation.  "
"If there is no medium present, the Doppler shifts are same irrespective of whether the source moves or the observer moves, since there is no way of distinction between the two situations.  "
Let us choose the convention to take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction of velocity.  
Consider a source S moving with velocity vs and an observer medium is also at rest.  
"Let the speed of a wave of angular frequency by an observer at rest with respect to ω and period To, both measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium, be v.  "
We assume that the observer has a detector that counts every time a wave crest reaches it.  
This reaches the observer at time t1 = L/v.  
"At time t = To the source has moved a distance vsTo and is at point S2, located at a distance  -LRB- L+vsTo -RRB-  from the observer.  "
"At S2, the source emits a second crest.  "
The observer thus measures a lower frequency when the source recedes from him than he does when it is at rest.  
He measures a higher frequency when the source approaches him.  
"Now to derive the Doppler shift when the observer is moving with velocity vo towards the source and the source is at rest, we have to proceed in a different manner.  "
We work in the reference frame of the moving observer.  
"The new distance between the observer and the source, O2 S2, would be L+ -LRB- vs–v0 -RRB- T0.  "
"At S2, the source emits a second crest.  "
Consider a passenger sitting in a train moving on a straight track.  
Suppose she hears a whistle sounded by the driver of the train.  
What frequency will she measure or hear?  
"Here both the observer and the source are moving with the same velocity, so there will be no shift in frequency and the passanger will note the natural frequency.  "
But an observer outside who is stationary with respect to the track will note a higher frequency if the train is approaching him and a lower frequency when it recedes from him.  
Note that we have defined the direction from the observer to the source as the positive.  
"Therefore, if the observer is moving towards the source, v0 has a positive  -LRB- numerical -RRB-  value whereas if O is moving away from S, v0 has a negative value.  "
"On the other hand, if S is moving away from O, vs has a positive value s has a negative value.  "
The sound emitted by the source travels in all directions.  
It is that part of sound coming towards the observer which the observer receives and detects.  
Therefore the relative velocity of sound with respect to the observer is v + v0 in all cases.  
"Since the source is approaching a stationary target, vs must be replaced by –vs.  "
The target is now the source  -LRB- because it is the source of echo -RRB-  and the rocket's detector is now the detector or observer  -LRB- because it detects echo -RRB- .  
"Thus, vs = 0 and vo has a positive value.  "
"The frequency of the sound emitted by the source  -LRB- the target -RRB-  is v, the frequency intercepted by the target and not vo.  "
"All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather.  "
This is almost inevitable with ladies garments like a polyester saree.  
Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon?  
Another common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the sky during thunderstorms.  
We also experience a sensation of an electric shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a bus after sliding from our seat.  
"The reason for these experiences is discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated due to rubbing of insulating surfaces.  "
You might have also heard that this is due to generation of static electricity.  
This is precisely the topic we are going to discuss in this and the next chapter.  
Static means anything that does not move or change with time.  
"Electrostatics deals with the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges.  "
The name electricity is coined from the Greek word elektron meaning amber.  
"Many such pairs of materials were known which on rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of papers.  "
You can perform the following activity at home to experience such an effect.  
Cut out long thin strips of white paper and lightly iron them.  
Take them near a TV screen or computer monitor.  
You will see that the strips get attracted to the screen.  
In fact they remain stuck to the screen for a while.  
"The two strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were rubbed, also repel each other.  "
"However, the glass rod and wool attracted each other.  "
"Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat's fur repelled each other  -LRB- Fig. 1.1  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB-  but attracted the fur.  "
"On the other hand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod  -LRB- Fig. 1.1  -LRB- c -RRB-  -RRB-  and repel the silk or wool with which the glass rod is rubbed.  "
The glass rod repels the fur.  
A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a glass rod rubbed with silk  -LRB- Fig. 1.1  -LRB- e -RRB-  -RRB- .  
A dramatic observation is that a pith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with plastic rod  -LRB- Fig. 1.1  -LRB- f -RRB-  -RRB- .  
These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts and careful experiments and their analyses.  
"It was concluded, after many careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of an entity which is called the electric charge.  "
"We say that the bodies like glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified.  "
They acquire an electric charge on rubbing.  
The experiments also demonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith balls on contact.  
It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged by contact.  
The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called the polarity of charge.  
"When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge.  "
This is true for any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified.  
"Now if the electrified glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they no longer attract each other.  "
They also do not attract or repel other light objects as they did on being electrified.  
"Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged bodies are brought in contact.  "
What can you conclude from these observations?  
It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects neutralise or nullify each other's effect.  
Therefore the charges were named as positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.  
"We know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of the same magnitude, the sum is zero.  "
This might have been the philosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative.  
"By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat's fur is called positive and that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative.  "
"If an object possesses an electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged.  "
When it has no charge it is said to be neutral.  
"In olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects.  "
"Electricity dealt with charges on glass rods, cat's fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism described interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc..  "
In 1820 Danish scientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current through a wire placed near the needle.  
Ampere and Faraday supported this observation by saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets generate electricity.  
The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell and the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the interdependence of these two subjects.  
This field is called electromagnetism.  
Most of the phenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism.  
Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces of nature.  
Maxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism as Newton's equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics.  
He also argued that light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely electric and magnetic measurements.  
He claimed that the science of optics is intimately related to that of electricity and magnetism.  
Students can make a simple electroscope as follows  -LRB- Fig. 1.2  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- :  
Take a thin aluminium curtain rod with ball ends fitted for hanging the curtain.  
Cut out a piece of length about 20 cm with the ball at one end and flatten the cut end.  
Take a large bottle that can hold this rod and a cork which will fit in the opening of the bottle ; Make a hole in the cork sufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly.  
Slide the rod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on the lower side and ball end projecting above the cork.  
"Fold a small, thin aluminium foil  -LRB- about 6 cm in length -RRB-  in the middle and attach it to the flattened end of the rod by cellulose tape.  "
This forms the leaves of your electroscope.  
Fit the cork in the bottle with about 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork.  
A paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance to measure the separation of leaves.  
The separation is a rough measure of the amount of charge on the electroscope.  
"To understand how the electroscope works, use the white paper strips we used for seeing the attraction of charged bodies.  "
Fold the strips into half so that you make a mark of fold.  
"Open the strip and iron it lightly with the mountain fold up, as shown in Fig. 1.3.  "
Hold the strip by pinching it at the fold.  
You would notice that the two halves move apart.  
This shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing.  
"When you fold it into half, both the halves have the same charge.  "
Hence they repel each other.  
The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope.  
"On charging the curtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is transferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil.  "
Both the halves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other.  
The divergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them.  
Let us first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge.  
You know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules.  
"Although normally the materials are electrically neutral, they do contain charges; but their charges are exactly balanced.  "
Thus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life.  
It is therefore essential that we learn more about such a force.  
"To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of charge.  "
"When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this excess charge or deficit of charge.  "
"In solids, some of the electrons, being less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred from one body to the other.  "
A body can thus be charged positively by losing some of its electrons.  
"Similarly, a body can be charged negatively by gaining electrons.  "
"When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth.  "
Thus the rod gets positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged.  
No new charge is created in the process of rubbing.  
"Also the number of electrons, that are transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the material body.  "
Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material body can be transferred from it to another by rubbing.  
A metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of being charged.  
"However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging.  "
Suppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and the other end to a negatively charged plastic rod.  
We will find that the pith ball acquires a negative charge.  
"If a similar experiment is repeated with a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take place from the plastic rod to the pith ball.  "
Why does the transfer of charge not take place from the rod to the ball?  
"Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others do not.  "
Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are called conductors.  
They have electric charges  -LRB- electrons -RRB-  that are comparatively free to move inside the material.  
"Metals, human and animal bodies and earth are conductors.  "
"Most of the non-metals like glass, porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of electricity through them.  "
They are called insulators.  
Most substances fall into one of the two classes stated above.  
"When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets distributed over the entire surface of the conductor.  "
"In contrast, if some charge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place.  "
You will learn why this happens in the next chapter.  
"This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article like spoon does not.  "
The charges on metal leak through our body to the ground as both are conductors of electricity.  
This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called grounding or earthing.  
Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical circuits and appliances.  
A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth and thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are used in buildings for the purpose of earthing near the mains supply.  
"The electric wiring in our houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth.  "
The first two carry electric current from the power station and the third is earthed by connecting it to the buried metal plate.  
"Metallic bodies of the electric appliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the earth wire.  "
"When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body, the charge flows to the earth   "
without damaging the appliance and without causing any injury to the humans; this would have otherwise been unavoidable since the human body is a conductor of electricity.  
"When we touch a pith ball with an electrified plastic rod, some of the negative charges on the rod are transferred to the pith ball and it also gets charged.  "
Thus the pith ball is charged by contact.  
It is then repelled by the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely charged.  
"However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is a question we have still left unanswered.  "
Let us try to understand what could be happening by performing the following experiment.  
" -LRB- i -RRB-  Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands, in contact as shown in Fig. 1.4  -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking care that it does not touch the sphere.  "
The free electrons in the spheres are attracted towards the rod.  
This leaves an excess of positive charge on the rear surface of sphere B.  
Both kinds of charges are bound in the metal spheres and can not escape.  
"They, therefore, reside on the surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4  -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
"The left surface of sphere A, has an excess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an excess of positive charge.  "
"However, not all of the electrons in the spheres have accumulated on the left surface of A.  "
"As the negative charge starts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled by these.  "
"In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of force of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the accumulated charges.  "
Fig. 1.4  -LRB- b -RRB-  shows the equilibrium situation.  
The process is called induction of charge and happens almost instantly.  
"The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown, till the glass rod is held near the sphere.  "
"If the rod is removed, the charges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to their original neutral state.  "
" -LRB- iii -RRB-  Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still held near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4  -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
The two spheres are found to be oppositely charged and attract each other.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Remove the rod.  
The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as shown in Fig. 1.4  -LRB- d -RRB- .  
"Now, separate the spheres quite apart.  "
"The charges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in Fig. 1.4  -LRB- e -RRB- .  "
"In this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely charged.  "
"The positively charged glass rod does not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by contact.  "
"When electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect takes place.  "
The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of the objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object.  
 -LRB- This happens even when the light object is not a conductor.  
The mechanism for how this happens is explained later in Sections 1.10 and 2.10. -RRB-   
The centres of the two types of charges are slightly separated.  
We know that opposite charges attract while similar charges repel.  
"However, the magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges and in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion.  "
"As a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are pulled towards the rods.  "
"In this experiment, the metal sphere gets charged by the process of induction and the rod does not lose any of its charge.  "
"Similar steps are involved in charging a metal sphere negatively by induction, by bringing a positively charged rod near it.  "
In this case the electrons will flow from the ground to the sphere when the sphere is connected to the ground with a wire.  
Can you explain why?  
"We have seen that there are two types of charges, namely positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each other.  "
"Here, we shall now describe some other properties of the electric charge.  "
"If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the distances between them, we treat them as point charges.  "
All the charge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point in space.  
We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall follow it up in the next section.  
We shall tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed.  
If a system contains n charges then the total charge of the system is . 
"Charge has magnitude but no direction, similar to the mass.  "
"However, there is one difference between mass and charge.  "
Mass of a body is always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative.  
Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system.  
"For example, the total charge of a system containing five charges and , in some arbitrary unit, is in the same unit.  "
A picture of particles of electric charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge.  
"When we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.  "
"Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is found that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved.  "
Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.  
It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed in a process.  
Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns into a proton and an electron.  
The proton and electron thus created have equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after the creation.  
Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples of a basic unit of charge denoted by e.  
"In this system, the value of the basic unit of charge is e = 1.602192 × 10 C Thus, there are about 6 × 10 electrons in a charge of — 1C.  "
"If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.  "
"Thus, if a body contains n electrons and n protons, the total amount of charge on the body is .  "
"Since n and n are integers, their difference is also an integer.  "
Thus the charge on any body is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps of e.  
"The step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic level, we deal with charges of a few μC.  "
At this scale the fact that charge of a body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible.  
The grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.  
This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points and lines.  
A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to us but is not continuous in reality.  
"As many points very close to each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.  "
"At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous compared to the magnitude of charge e.  "
"Since e = 1.6 × 10 C, a charge of magnitude, say 1 μC, contains something like 10 times the electronic charge.  "
"At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in units of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous values.  "
"Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no practical consequence and can be ignored.  "
It is the scale involved that is very important.  
Coulomb's law is a quantitative statement about the force between two point charges.  
"When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the charged bodies are treated as point charges.  "
Coulomb used a torsion balance for measuring the force between two charged metallic spheres.  
"When the separation between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.  "
"However, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin with.  "
How then could he discover a relation like Eq.  -LRB- 1.1 -RRB- ?  
Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge on a metallic sphere is q.  
"If the sphere is put in contact with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over the two spheres.  "
"By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will be q/2.  "
"Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4, etc..  "
Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and measured the force for different separations.  
"He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair.  "
"Comparing forces for different pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq.  -LRB- 1.1 -RRB- .  "
"Coulomb's law, a simple mathematical statement, was initially experimentally arrived at in the manner described above.  "
"While the original experiments established it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been established down to subatomic level  -LRB- r ~ 10 m -RRB- .  "
Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit magnitude of the charge.  
"In fact, it is the other way round: Coulomb's law can now be employed to furnish a definition for a unit of charge.  "
"In the relation, Eq.  -LRB- 1.1 -RRB- , k is so far arbitrary.  "
We can choose any positive value of k.  
The choice of k determines the size of the unit of charge.  
"In SI units, the value of k is about 9 × 10.  "
The unit of charge that results from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section 1.4.  
One coulomb is evidently too big a unit to be used.  
"In practice, in electrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 μC.  "
"The value of ε in SI units is = 8.854 × 10 C N m Since force is a vector, it is better to write Coulomb's law in the vector notation.  "
Let the position vectors of charges q and q be r and r respectively  -LRB- see Fig.1.6  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  
We denote force on q due to q by F and force on q due to q by F.  
The two point charges q and q have been numbered 1 and 2 for convenience  
The direction of a vector is specified by a unit vector along the vector.  
"If q and q are of opposite signs, F is along —  -LRB- = -RRB- , which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges.  "
"Thus, we do not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike charges.  "
Equation  -LRB- 1.3 -RRB-  takes care of both cases correctly  -LRB- Fig. 1.6  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  
• Coulomb's law  -LRB- Eq.  -LRB- 1.3 -RRB-  -RRB-  gives the force between two charges q and q in vacuum.  
"If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening space has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence of charged constituents of matter.  "
We shall consider electrostatics in matter in the next chapter.  
The mutual electric force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law.  
How to calculate the force on a charge where there are not one but several charges around?  
"Consider a system of n stationary charges q, q, q,..., q in vacuum.  "
"What is the force on q due to q, q,..., q?  "
Coulomb's law is not enough to answer this question.  
Recall that forces of mechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of addition.  
Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?  
The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of other charges.  
This is termed as the principle of superposition.  
"To better understand the concept, consider a system of three charges q q and q, as shown in Fig. 1.8  -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
"The force on one charge, say q, due to two other charges q, q can therefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the forces due to each one of these charges.  "
"Thus, if the force on q due to q is denoted by F, F is given by Eq.  -LRB- 1.3 -RRB-  even though other charges are present.  "
"The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges, the force on q due to q is the same as given by Coulomb's law, i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges.  "
"The total force F on the charge q, due to all other charges, is then given by the vector sum of the forces :  "
"i.e.,  -LRB- 1.5 -RRB-  The vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law of addition of vectors.  "
All of electrostatics is basically a consequence of Coulomb's law and the superposition principle.  
"18 Let us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O.  "
"If we place another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q will exert a force on q as per Coulomb's law.  "
"We may ask the question: If charge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding?  "
Is there nothing?  
"If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act when we place the charge q at P.  "
"In order to answer such questions, the early scientists introduced the concept of field.  "
"According to this, we say that the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.  "
"When another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on it and produces a force.  "
"The electric field produced by the charge Q at a point r is given as  -LRB- 1.6 -RRB-  where r/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r.  "
"Thus, Eq.  -LRB- 1.6 -RRB-  specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position vector r.  "
"The word ""field "" signifies how some distributed quantity  -LRB- which could be a scalar or a vector -RRB-  varies with position.  "
The effect of the charge has been incorporated in the existence of the electric field.  
"We obtain the force F exerted by a charge Q on a charge q, as  -LRB- 1.7 -RRB-  Note that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the charge Q.  "
The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be looked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of Q and vice versa.  
"If we denote the position of charge q by the vector r, it experiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric field E at the location of q.  "
"Thus, F  -LRB- r -RRB-  = q E  -LRB- r -RRB-   -LRB- 1.8 -RRB-  Equation  -LRB- 1.8 -RRB-  defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C.  "
"Thus, the electric field due to a charge Q at a point in space may be defined as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed at that point.  "
"The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is called a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a source charge, is called a test charge.  "
Note that the source charge Q must remain at its original location.  
"However, if a charge q is brought at any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical force due to q and will tend to move.  "
A way out of this difficulty is to make q negligibly small.  
This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.  
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in terms of some test charge q, is independent of q.  "
"This is because F is proportional to q, so the ratio F / q does not depend on q.  "
The force F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular location of charge q which may take any value in the space around the charge Q.  
"Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on the space coordinate r.  "
"For different positions of the charge q all over the space, we get different values of electric field E.  "
The field exists at every point in three-dimensional space.  
" -LRB- iii -RRB-  For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially outwards from the charge.  "
"On the other hand, if the source charge is negative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.  "
"Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude of its electric field E is same.  "
"The magnitude of electric field E due to a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its center; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.  "
Consider a system of charges with position vectors relative to some origin O.  
without disturbing the original positions of charges.  
We can use Coulomb's law and the superposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by position vector r.  
Electric field E at r due to q at r is given by   
"E = where is a unit vector in the direction from q to P, and r is the distance between q and P.  "
Similar expressions hold good for fields due to charges .  
"By the superposition principle, the electric field E at r due to the system of charges is  -LRB- as shown in Fig. 1.12 -RRB-   "
"The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however, emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time - dependent electromagnetic phenomena.  "
"Suppose we consider the force between two distant charges q, q in accelerated motion.  "
"Now the greatest speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another is c, the speed of light.  "
"Thus, the effect of any motion of q on q can not arise instantaneously.  "
There will be some time delay between the effect  -LRB- force on q -RRB-  and the cause  -LRB- motion of q -RRB- .  
"It is precisely here that the notion of electric field  -LRB- strictly, electromagnetic field -RRB-  is natural and very useful.  "
"The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed c, reach q and cause a force on q.  "
The notion of field elegantly accounts for the time delay.  
"Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be detected only by their effects  -LRB- forces -RRB-  on charges, they are regarded as physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs.  "
"They have an independent dynamics of their own, i.e., they evolve according to laws of their own.  "
They can also transport energy.  
"Thus, a source of time - dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on briefly and switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields transporting energy.  "
The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday and is now among the central concepts in physics.  
23 We have studied electric field in the last section.  
It is a vector quantity and can be represented as we represent vectors.  
Let us try to represent E due to a point charge pictorially.  
Let the point charge be placed at the origin.  
Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the electric field with their lengths proportional to the strength of the field at each point.  
Figure 1.15 shows such a picture.  
"In this figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the force acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of that arrow.  "
Connect the arrows pointing in one direction and the resulting figure represents a field line.  
"We thus get many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point charge.  "
"Have we lost the information about the strength or magnitude of the field now, because it was contained in the length of the arrow?  "
Now the magnitude of the field is represented by the density of field lines.  
"E is strong near the charge,  "
so the density of field lines is more near the charge and the lines are closer.  
"Away from the charge, the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less, resulting in well-separated lines.  "
Another person may draw more lines.  
But the number of lines is not important.  
"In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.  "
It is the relative density of lines in different regions which is important.  
"We draw the figure on the plane of paper, i.e., in two - dimensions but we live in three-dimensions.  "
"So if one wishes to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular to the lines.  "
We started by saying that the field lines carry information about the direction of electric field at different points in space.  
"Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density  -LRB- i.e., closeness -RRB-  of the field lines at different points indicates the relative strength of electric field at those points.  "
The field lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart where it is weak.  
Figure 1.16 shows a set of field lines.  
The number of lines  -LRB- say n -RRB-  cutting these area elements are the same.  
"The number of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n /  -LRB- ΔΩ -RRB-  and n /  -LRB- ΔΩ -RRB-  at P, respectively.  "
"Since n and ΔΩ are common, the strength of the field clearly has a 1 / r dependence.  "
The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an intuitive non - mathematical way of visualizing electric fields around charged configurations.  
Faraday called them lines of force.  
"This term is somewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields.  "
The more appropriate term is field lines  -LRB- electric or magnetic -RRB-  that we have adopted in this book.  
Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric field around a configuration of charges.  
"An electric field line is, in general, a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each point is in the direction of the net field at that point.  "
An arrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the direction of electric field from the two possible directions indicated by a tangent to the curve.  
"A field line is a space curve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.  "
Figure 1.17 shows the field lines around some simple charge configurations.  
"As mentioned earlier, the field lines are in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them only in a plane.  "
The field lines of a single positive charge are radially outward while those of a single negative charge are radially inward.  
The field lines follow some important general properties:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Field lines start from positive charges and end at negative charges.  
"If there is a single charge, they may start or end at infinity.  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken to be continuous curves without any breaks.  "
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  Two field lines can never cross each other.  
" -LRB- If they did, the field at the point of intersection will not have a unique direction, which is absurd. -RRB-   "
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Electro static field lines do not form any closed loops.  
This follows from the conservative nature of electric field  -LRB- Chapter 2 -RRB- .  
"Consider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small flat surface d S, in a direction normal to the surface.  "
The rate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the area per unit time d S and represents the flux of liquid flowing across the plane.  
Therefore the flux going out of the surface d S is v. d S.  
"For the case of the electric field, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric flux.  "
We should however note that there is no flow of a physically observable quantity unlike the case of liquid flow.  
"This means that if we place a small planar element of area Δ S normal to E at a point, the number of field lines crossing it is proportional to E Δ S.  "
Now suppose we tilt the area element by angle θ.  
"Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the area element will be smaller.  "
The projection of the area element normal to E is Δ S cos θ.  
"Thus, the number of field lines crossing Δ S is proportional to E Δ S cos θ.  "
"When θ = 90 °, field lines will be parallel to Δ S and will not cross it at all  -LRB- Fig. 1.18 -RRB- .  "
The orientation of area element and not merely its magnitude is important in many contexts.  
"For example, in a stream, the amount of water flowing through a ring will naturally depend on how you hold the ring.  "
"If you hold it normal to the flow, maximum water will flow through it than if you hold it with some other orientation.  "
This shows that an area element should be treated as a vector.  
It has a magnitude and also a direction.  
How to specify the direction of a planar area?  
"Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the plane.  "
Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.  
How to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface?  
We imagine dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.  
"Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated with it, as explained before.  "
Notice one ambiguity here.  
The direction of an area element is along its normal.  
But a normal can point in two directions.  
Which direction do we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?  
This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given context.  
"For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.  "
The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken to be in the direction of the outward normal.  
This is the convention used in Fig. 1.19.  
This is mathematically exact only when you take the limit Δ S → 0 and the sum in Eq.  -LRB- 1.12 -RRB-  is written as an integral.  
"An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and — q, separated by a distance 2 a.  "
The line connecting the two charges defines a direction in space.  
"By convention, the direction from — q to q is said to be the direction of the dipole.  "
The mid-point of locations of — q and q is called the center of the dipole.  
The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero.  
This does not mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero.  
"Since the charge q and — q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when added, do not exactly cancel out.  "
The components along the dipole axis add up.  
The total electric field is opposite to.  
This suggests the definition of dipole moment.  
"In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distances takes simple forms:  "
"Further, the magnitude and the direction of the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the angle between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.  "
Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole.  
"For a point dipole, Eqs.  -LRB- 1.20 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 1.21 -RRB-  are exact, true for any r.  "
"In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges lie at the same place.  "
"Therefore, their dipole moment is zero.  "
CO and CH are of this type of molecules.  
"However, they develop a dipole moment when an electric field is applied.  "
"But in some molecules, the centres of negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide.  "
"Therefore they have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric field.  "
Such molecules are called polar molecules.  
"Water molecules, H O, is an example of this type.  "
Various materials give rise to interesting properties and important applications in the presence or absence of electric field.  
"31 Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform external field E, as shown in Fig. 1.22.  "
" -LRB- By permanent dipole, we mean that p exists irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E. -RRB-   "
There is a force qE on q and a force — qE on — q.  
"The net force on the dipole is zero, since E is uniform.  "
"However, the charges are separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque on the dipole.  "
"When the net force is zero, the torque  -LRB- couple -RRB-  is independent of the origin.  "
Its magnitude equals the magnitude of each force multiplied by the arm of the couple  -LRB- perpendicular distance between the two antiparallel forces -RRB- .  
"Magnitude of torque Its direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.  "
"The magnitude of p × E is also p E sin θ and its direction is normal to the paper, coming out of it.  "
"Thus, τ = p × E  -LRB- 1.22 -RRB-  This torque will tend to align the dipole with the field E.  "
"When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.  "
What happens if the field is not uniform?  
"In that case, the net force will evidently be non-zero.  "
"In addition there will, in general, be a torque on the system as before.  "
"The general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler situations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E.  "
"In either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force on the dipole if E is not uniform.  "
Figure 1.23 is self-explanatory.  
"It is easily seen that when p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the direction of increasing field.  "
"When p is antiparallel to E, the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing field.  "
"In general, the force depends on the orientation of p with respect to E.  "
This brings us to a common observation in frictional electricity.  
A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of paper.  
"The comb, as we know, acquires charge through friction.  "
But the paper is not charged.  
What then explains the attractive force?  
"Taking the clue from the preceding discussion, the charged comb ' polarizes ' the piece of paper, i.e., induces a net dipole moment in the direction of field.  "
"Further, the electric field due to the comb is not uniform.  "
"In this situation, it is easily seen that the paper should move in the direction of the comb!  "
We have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges .  
One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus.  
"For many purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions.  "
"For example, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify the charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged constituents.  "
The surface charge density σ so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level.  
"σ represents macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out average of the microscopic charge density over an area element Δ S which, as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically.  "
The units for σ are C/m.  
Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume charge distribution.  
The linear charge density λ of a wire is defined by  -LRB- 1.24 -RRB-   
"where Δ l is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,  "
"however, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents, and Δ Q is the charge contained in that line element.  "
The units for λ are C/m.  
The volume charge density  -LRB- sometimes simply called charge density -RRB-  is defined in a similar manner:  -LRB- 1.25 -RRB-   
where Δ Q is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume element Δ V that includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents.  
The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we adopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics.  
"When we refer to the density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density.  "
We regard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular constitution.  
"The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in much the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq.  -LRB- 1.10 -RRB- .  "
Suppose a continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density ρ.  
Choose any convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the charge distribution be r.  
"The charge density ρ may vary from point to point, i.e., it is a function of r.  "
Divide the charge distribution into small volume elements of size Δ V.  
The charge in a volume element Δ V is ρ Δ V.  
"Now, consider any general point P  -LRB- inside or outside the distribution -RRB-  with position vector R  -LRB- Fig. 1.24 -RRB- .  "
"By the superposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge distribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different volume elements:  "
" -LRB- 1.27 -RRB-  Note that ρ, r ′, all can vary from point to point.  "
"In a strict mathematical method, we should let Δ V → 0 and the sum then becomes an integral;  "
"but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity.  "
"In short, using Coulomb's law and the superposition principle, electric field can be determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part discrete and part continuous.  "
"As a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the total flux through a sphere of radius r, which encloses a point charge q at its center.  "
"Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in Fig. 1.25.  "
The flux through an area element ΔS is  -LRB- 1.28 -RRB-  where we have used Coulomb's law for the electric field due to a single charge q.  
The unit vector is along the radius vector from the center to the area element.  
"Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is along the radius vector at that point, the area element ΔS and have the same direction.  "
"Therefore,  -LRB- 1.29 -RRB-  since the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.  "
"Thus,  -LRB- 1.30 -RRB-  Equation  -LRB- 1.30 -RRB-  is a simple illustration of a general result of electrostatics called Gauss's law.  "
We state Gauss's law without proof: Electric flux through a closed surface S = q / ε  -LRB- 1.31 -RRB-  q = total charge enclosed by S.  
The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is zero if no charge is enclosed by the surface.  
We can see that explicitly in the simple situation of Fig. 1.26.  
"Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E.  "
The total flux φ through the surface is  
where φ and φ represent the flux through the surfaces 1 and 2  -LRB- of circular cross-section -RRB-  of the cylinder and φ is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the closed surface.  
"Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is perpendicular to E, so by definition of flux.  "
"Further, the outward normal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.  "
"Therefore, where S is the area of circular cross-section.  "
"Thus, the total flux is zero, as expected by Gauss's law.  "
"Thus, whenever you find that the net electric flux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge contained in the closed surface is zero.  "
"Let us note some important points regarding this law:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Gauss's law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape or size.  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  The term q on the right side of Gauss's law, Eq.  -LRB- 1.31 -RRB- , includes the sum of all charges enclosed by the surface.  "
The charges may be located anywhere inside the surface.  
"The term q on the right side of Gauss's law, however, represents only the total charge inside S.  "
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss's law is called the Gaussian surface.  
You may choose any Gaussian surface and apply Gauss's law.  
"However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface pass through any discrete charge.  "
This is because electric field due to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of any charge.  
" -LRB- As you go close to the charge, the field grows without any bound. -RRB-   "
"However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a continuous charge distribution.  "
 -LRB- v -RRB-  Gauss's law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the electrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  
This is facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.  
" -LRB- vi -RRB-  Finally, Gauss's law is based on the inverse square dependence on distance contained in the Coulomb's law.  "
Any violation of Gauss's law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.  
"The electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above, given by Eq.  -LRB- 1.27 -RRB- .  "
"In practice, except for some special cases, the summation  -LRB- or integration -RRB-  involved in this equation can not be carried out to give electric field at every point in space.  "
"For some symmetric charge configurations, however, it is possible to obtain the electric field in a simple way using the Gauss's law.  "
This is best understood by some examples.  
Consider an infinitely long thin straight wire with uniform linear charge density λ.  
The wire is obviously an axis of symmetry.  
Suppose we take the radial vector from O to P and rotate it around the wire.  
The points so obtained are completely equivalent with respect to the charged wire.  
This implies that the electric field must have the same magnitude at these points.  
"The direction of electric field at every point must be radial  -LRB- outward if λ  _GREAT_GT;  0, inward if λ  _LESS_LT;  0 -RRB- .  "
This is clear from Fig. 1.29.  
"Consider a pair of line elements P and P of the wire, as shown.  "
The electric fields produced by the two elements of the pair when summed give a resultant electric field which is radial  -LRB- the components normal to the radial vector cancel -RRB- .  
This is true for any such pair and  
hence the total field at any point P is radial.  
"Finally, since the wire is infinite, electric field does not depend on the position of P along the length of the wire.  "
"In short, the electric field is everywhere radial in the plane cutting the wire normally, and its magnitude depends only on the radial distance r.  "
"To calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical Gaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.29  -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
"Since the field is everywhere radial, flux through the two ends of the cylindrical Gaussian surface is zero.  "
"At the cylindrical part of the surface, E is normal to the surface at every point, and its magnitude is constant, since it depends only on r.  "
"The surface area of the curved part is 2 π rl, where l is the length of the cylinder.  "
Flux through the Gaussian surface = flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface = E × 2 π rl The surface includes charge equal to λ l.  
E is directed outward if λ is positive and inward if λ is negative.  
"Note that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit vector, i.e., as A = A, the scalar A is an algebraic number.  "
It can be negative or positive.  
The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit vector if A  _GREAT_GT;  0 and opposite to if A  _LESS_LT;  0.  
"When we want to restrict to non-negative values, we use the symbol and call it the modulus of A.  "
"Thus,.  "
"Also note that though only the charge enclosed by the surface  -LRB- λ l -RRB-  was included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire wire.  "
"Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial.  "
"Without this assumption, we can not take E to be normal to the curved part of the cylindrical Gaussian surface.  "
"However, Eq.  -LRB- 1.32 -RRB-  is approximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long wire, where the end effects may be ignored.  "
Let σ be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet  -LRB- Fig. 1.30 -RRB- .  
We take the x-axis normal to the given plane.  
"By symmetry, the electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction at every point must be parallel to the x-direction.  "
"We can take the Gaussian surface to be a rectangular parallelepiped of cross sectional area A, as shown.  "
 -LRB- A cylindrical surface will also do. -RRB-   
"As seen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will contribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel to the other faces and they, therefore, do not contribute to the total flux.  "
The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in — x direction while the unit vector normal to surface 2 is in the + x direction.  
"Therefore, flux E. ΔS through both the surfaces are equal and add up.  "
Therefore the net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA.  
The charge enclosed by the closed surface is σ A.  
"Therefore by Gauss's law, Vectorically,  -LRB- 1.33 -RRB-  where is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.  "
E is directed away from the plate if σ is positive and toward the plate if σ is negative.  
Note that the above application of the Gauss ' law has brought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.  
"For a finite large planar sheet, Eq.  -LRB- 1.33 -RRB-  is approximately true in the middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.  "
Let σ be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of radius R  -LRB- Fig. 1.31 -RRB- .  
The situation has obvious spherical symmetry.  
"The field at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r  -LRB- the radial distance from the center of the shell to the point  "
" -RRB-  and must be radial  -LRB- i.e., along the radius vector -RRB- .  "
 -LRB- i -RRB-  Field outside the shell: Consider a point P outside the shell with radius vector r.  
"To calculate E at P, we take the Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with center O, passing through P.  "
All points on this sphere are equivalent relative to the given charged configuration.  
 -LRB- That is what we mean by spherical symmetry. -RRB-   
"The electric field at each point of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude E and is along the radius vector at each point.  "
"Thus, E and ΔS at every point are parallel and the flux through each element is E Δ S.  "
"Summing over all Δ S, the flux through the Gaussian surface is E × 4 π r.  "
The charge enclosed is σ × 4 π R.  
"By Gauss's law E × 4 π r = Or, where q = 4 π R σ is the total charge on the spherical shell.  "
"Vectorially,  -LRB- 1.34 -RRB-  The electric field is directed outward if q  _GREAT_GT;  0 and inward if q  _LESS_LT;  0.  "
Consideration of these symmetries helps one arrive at results much faster than otherwise by a straightforward calculation.  
"Consider, for example an infinite uniform sheet of charge  -LRB- surface charge density σ -RRB-  along the y - z plane.  "
"This system is unchanged if  -LRB- a -RRB-  translated parallel to the y - z plane in any direction,  -LRB- b -RRB-  rotated about the x-axis through any angle.  "
"As the system is unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be.  "
"In particular, in this example, the electric field E must be unchanged.  "
"Translation symmetry along the y-axis shows that the electric field must be the same at a point  -LRB- 0, y, 0 -RRB-  as at  -LRB- 0, y, 0 -RRB- .  "
"Similarly translational symmetry along the z-axis shows that the electric field at two point  -LRB- 0, 0, z -RRB-  and  -LRB- 0, 0, z -RRB-  must be the same.  "
"By using rotation symmetry around the x-axis, we can conclude that E must be perpendicular to the y - z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the x-direction.  "
"Try to think of a symmetry now which will tell you that the magnitude of the electric field is a constant, independent of the x-coordinate.  "
It thus turns out that the magnitude of the electric field due to a uniformly charged infinite conducting sheet is the same at all points in space.  
"The direction, however, is opposite of each other on either side of the sheet.  "
Compare this with the effort needed to arrive at this result by a direct calculation using Coulomb's law.  
"﻿In Chapters 6 and 8  -LRB- Class XI -RRB- , the notion of potential energy was introduced.  "
"With reference to Fig. 2.1, this will happen if Q and q are both positive or both negative.  "
"For definiteness, let us take Q, q  _GREAT_GT;  0.  "
Two remarks may be made here.  
"Second, in bringing the charge q from R to P, we apply an external force F ext just enough to counter the repulsive electric force FE  -LRB- i.e, Fext = —FE -RRB- .  "
"This means there is no net force on or acceleration of the charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is brought with infinitesimally slow constant speed.  "
"In this situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work done by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential energy of the charge q.  "
This work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored as potential energy.  
" -LRB- Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric force and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –WRP . -RRB-  "
Two important comments may be made at this stage:  
 -LRB- i -RRB-  The right side of Eq.  -LRB- 2.2 -RRB-  depends only on the initial and final positions of the charge.  
This is the fundamental characteristic of a conservative force.  
The concept of the potential energy would not be meaningful if the work depended on the path.  
The path-independence of work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the Coulomb’s law.  
We omit this proof here.  
Equation  -LRB- 2.2 -RRB-  defines potential energy difference in terms of the physically meaningful quantity work.  
"Clearly, potential energy so defined is undetermined to within an additive constant.  "
What this means is that the actual value of potential energy is not physically significant; it is only the difference of potential energy that is significant.  
"We can always add an arbitrary constant α to potential energy at every point, since this will not change the potential energy difference.  "
"Put it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point where potential energy is zero.  "
A convenient choice is to have electrostatic potential energy zero at infinity.  
Consider any general static charge configuration.  
We define potential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work done on the charge q.  
"This work is obviously proportional to q, since the force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at that point due to the given charge configuration.  "
"It is, therefore, convenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, so that the resulting quantity is independent of q.  "
"In other words, work done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric field associated with the charge configuration.  "
This leads to the idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given charge configuration.  
"Note, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potential difference that is physically significant.  "
"In other words, the electrostatic potential  -LRB- V -RRB-  at any point in a region with electrostatic field is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge  -LRB- without acceleration -RRB-  from infinity to that point.  "
The qualifying remarks made earlier regarding potential energy also apply to the definition of potential.  
"Also, the external force at every point of the path is to be equal and opposite to the electrostatic force on the test charge at that point.  "
Consider a point charge Q at the origin.  
"For definiteness, take Q to be positive.  "
We wish to determine the potential at any point P with position vector r from the origin.  
"For that we must calculate the work done in bringing a unit positive test charge from infinity to the point P. For Q  _GREAT_GT;  0, the work done against the repulsive force on the test charge is positive.  "
Total work done  -LRB- W -RRB-  by the external force is obtained by integrating Eq.  -LRB- 2.6 -RRB-  from r′ = ∞ to r′ = r.   
"Work done on a test charge q by the electrostatic field due to any given charge configuration is independent of the path, and depends only on its initial and final positions.  "
"Equation  -LRB- 2.8 -RRB-  is true for any sign of the charge Q, though we considered Q  _GREAT_GT;  0 in its derivation.  "
"For Q  _LESS_LT;  0, V  _LESS_LT;  0, i.e., work done  -LRB- by the external force -RRB-  per unit positive test charge in bringing it from infinity to the point is negative.  "
This is equivalent to saying that work done by the electrostatic force in bringing the unit positive charge form infinity to the point P is positive.  
"Finally, we note that Eq.  -LRB- 2.8 -RRB-  is consistent with the choice that potential at infinity be zero.  "
Figure  -LRB- 2.4 -RRB-  shows how the electrostatic potential  -LRB- ∝ 1/r -RRB-  and the electrostatic field  -LRB- ∝ 1/r2 -RRB-  varies with r.  
"As we learnt in the last chapter, an electric dipole consists of two charges q and —q separated by a  -LRB- small -RRB-  distance 2a.  "
Its total charge is zero ; It is characterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q × 2a and which points in the direction from —q to q.  
"We also saw that the electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector r depends not just on the magnitude r, but also on the angle between r and p.  "
"Further, the field falls off, at large distance, not as 1/r2  -LRB- typical of field due to a single charge -RRB-  but as 1/r3.  "
"We, now, determine the electric potential due to a dipole and contrast it with the potential due to a single charge.  "
"As before, we take the origin at the center of the dipole.  "
Now we know that the electric field obeys the superposition principle.  
"Since potential is related to the work done by the field, electrostatic potential also follows the superposition principle.  "
"Thus, the potential due to the dipole is the sum of potentials due to the charges q and — q.  "
"For a point dipole p at the origin, Eq.  -LRB- 2.15 -RRB-  is, however, exact.  "
The potential in the equatorial plane  -LRB- θ = π/2 -RRB-  is zero.  
"It is, however, axially symmetric about p.  "
"That is, if you rotate the position vector r about p, keeping θ fixed, the points corresponding to P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P.  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1/r2, not as 1/r, characteristic of the potential due to a single charge.  "
" -LRB- You can refer to the Fig. 2.5 for graphs of 1/r2 versus r and 1/r versus r, drawn there in another context. -RRB-   "
"Consider a system of charges q1, q2,..., qn with position vectors r1, r2,..., rn relative to some origin.  "
"By the superposition principle, the potential V at P due to the total charge configuration is the algebraic sum of the potentials due to the individual charges,.  "
"If we have a continuous charge distribution characterised by a charge density ρ, we divide it, as before, into small volume elements each of size ∆v and carrying a charge ρ∆v.  "
"We then determine the potential due to each volume element and sum  -LRB- strictly speaking, integrate -RRB-  over all such contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire distribution.  "
"We have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated at the center.  "
The electric field inside the shell is zero.  
An equipotential surface is a surface with a constant value of potential at all points on the surface.  
This shows that V is a constant if r is constant.  
"Thus, equipotential surfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred at the charge.  "
"Now the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting from or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative.  "
"Clearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface passing through that point.  "
"This is true in general: for any charge configuration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the electric field at that point.  "
The proof of this statement is simple.  
"If the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would have non-zero component along the surface.  "
"To move a unit test charge against the direction of the component of the field, work would have to be done.  "
"The electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface at every point.  "
Equipotential surfaces offer an alternative visual picture in addition to the picture of electric field lines around a charge configuration.  
Equipotential surfaces for  -LRB- a -RRB-  a dipole and  -LRB- b -RRB-  two identical positive charges are shown in Fig. 2.11.  
"Consider two closely spaced equipotential surfaces A and B  -LRB- Fig. 2.12 -RRB-  with potential values V and V + δV, where δV is the change in V in the direction of the electric field E.  "
Let P be a point on the surface B.  
δl is the perpendicular distance of the surface A from P.  
Imagine that a unit positive charge is moved along this perpendicular from the surface B to surface A against the electric field.  
The work done in this process is -PIPE-E-PIPE- δl.  
This work equals the potential difference VA — VB.  
We thus arrive at two important conclusions concerning the relation between electric field and potential:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases steepest.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potential per unit displacement normal to the equipotential surface at the point.  
Consider first the simple case of two charges q1 and q2 with position vector r1 and r2 relative to some origin.  
Let us calculate the work done  -LRB- externally -RRB-  in building up this configuration.  
This means that we consider the charges q1 and q2 initially at infinity and determine the work done by an external agency to bring the charges to the given locations.  
"Suppose, first the charge q1 is brought from infinity to the point r1.  "
"There is no external field against which work needs to be done, so work done in bringing q1 from infinity to r1 is zero.  "
"From the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge q2 from infinity to the point r2 is q2 times the potential at r2 due to q1.  "
"Since electrostatic force is conservative, this work gets stored in the form of potential energy of the system.  "
"Obviously, if q2 was brought first to its present location and q1 brought later, the potential energy U would be the same.  "
Equation  -LRB- 2.22 -RRB-  is true for any sign of q1 and q2.  
"If q1 q2  _GREAT_GT;  0, potential energy is positive.  "
"For unlike charges  -LRB- q1 q2  _LESS_LT;  0 -RRB- , the electrostatic force is attractive.  "
"In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this force to take the charges from the given location to infinity.  "
"In other words, a negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path  -LRB- from infinity to the present locations -RRB- , so the potential energy is negative.  "
Equation  -LRB- 2.22 -RRB-  is easily generalised for a system of any number of point charges.  
"Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three charges q1, q2 and q3 located at r1, r2, r3, respectively.  "
"To bring q1 first from infinity to r1, no work is required.  "
Next we bring q2 from infinity to r2.  
"Work done next in bringing q3 from infinity to the point r3 is q3 times V1,2 at r3.  "
The total work done in assembling the charges at the given locations is obtained by adding the work done in different steps  -LRB- Eq.  -LRB- 2.23 -RRB-  and Eq.  -LRB- 2.25 -RRB-  -RRB- .  
Potential energy of a system of charges q1 and q2 is directly proportional to the product of charges and inversely to the distance between them.  
"Potential energy of a system of three charges is given by Eq.  -LRB- 2.26 -RRB- , with the notation given in the figure.  "
"The potential energy is characteristic of the present state of configuration, and not the way the state is achieved.  "
"In Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was specified — the charges and their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges was determined.  "
"In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.  "
What is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field?  
"This question was, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic potential  -LRB- Sections 2.1 and 2.2 -RRB- .  "
But here we address this question again to clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.  
The main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential energy of a charge  -LRB- or charges -RRB-  in an external field.  
The external field E is not produced by the given charge -LRB- s -RRB-  whose potential energy we wish to calculate.  
E is produced by sources external to the given charge -LRB- s -RRB- .  
"The external sources may be known, but often they are unknown or unspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic potential V due to the external sources.  "
We assume that the charge q does not significantly affect the sources producing the external field.  
"This is true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other unspecified forces.  "
The external electric field E and the corresponding external potential V may vary from point to point.  
"Thus, work done in bringing a charge q from infinity to the point P in the external field is q V.  "
This work is stored in the form of potential energy of q.  
"Thus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10—19 C is accelerated by a potential difference of ∆V = 1 volt, it would gain energy of q∆V = 1.6×10—19 J.  "
"This unit of energy is defined as 1 electron volt or 1eV, i.e., 1eV = 1.6 × 10—19 J.  "
"Potential energy of a system of two charges in an external field Next, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges q1 and q2 located at r1 and r2, respectively, in an external field?  "
"First, we calculate the work done in bringing the charge q1 from infinity to r1.  "
"Next, we consider the work done in bringing q2 to r2.  "
"In this step, work is done not only against the external field E but also against the field due to q1.  "
Work done on q2 against the field due to q1 where r12 is the distance between q1 and q2.  
We have made use of Eqs.  -LRB- 2.27 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 2.22 -RRB- .  
We can then associate potential energy U -LRB- θ -RRB-  with an inclination θ of the dipole.  
"Similar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the angle where the potential energy U is taken to be zero.  "
A natural choice is to take θ0 = π/2.  
 -LRB- Αn explanation for it is provided towards the end of discussion. -RRB-   
This expression can alternately be understood also from Eq.  -LRB- 2.29 -RRB- .  
We apply Eq.  -LRB- 2.29 -RRB-  to the present system of two charges +q and —q.  
"Here, r1 and r2 denote the position vectors of +q and —q.  "
These electrons are free within the metal but not free to leave the metal.  
"The free electrons form a kind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move randomly in different directions.  "
"In an external electric field, they drift against the direction of the field.  "
The positive ions made up of the nuclei and the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions.  
We shall restrict our discussion to metallic solid conductors.  
Let us note important results regarding electrostatics of conductors.  
"Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero.  "
"Consider a conductor, neutral or charged.  "
There may also be an external electrostatic field.  
"In the static situation, when there is no current inside or on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere inside the conductor.  "
This fact can be taken as the defining property of a conductor.  
A conductor has free electrons.  
"As long as electric field is not zero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift.  "
"In the static situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the electric field is zero everywhere inside.  "
Electrostatic field is zero inside a conductor.  
"At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field must be normal to the surface at every point.  "
"If E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero component along the surface.  "
Free charges on the surface of the conductor would then experience force and move.  
"In the static situation, therefore, E should have no tangential component.  "
Thus electrostatic field at the surface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every point.  
"This means there is no net charge at any point inside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface.  "
Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume of the conductor and has the same value  -LRB- as inside -RRB-  on its surface.  
This follows from results 1 and 2 above.  
"Since E = 0 inside the conductor and has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in moving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface.  "
"In a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and charge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant value of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to the other.  "
"To derive the result, choose a pill box  -LRB- a short cylinder -RRB-  as the Gaussian surface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17.  "
The pill box is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor.  
It has a small area of cross section δS and negligible height.  
"Just inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the field is normal to the surface with magnitude E.  "
"Thus, the contribution to the total flux through the pill box comes only from the outside  -LRB- circular -RRB-  cross-section of the pill box.  "
The charge enclosed by the pill box is σδS.  
"For σ  _GREAT_GT;  0, electric field is normal to the surface outward; for σ  _LESS_LT;  0, electric field is normal to the surface inward.  "
"Consider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity.  "
We have proved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged spherical shell is zero.  
The proof of the result for the shell makes use of the spherical symmetry of the shell  -LRB- see Chapter 1 -RRB- .  
"But the vanishing of electric field in the  -LRB- charge-free -RRB-  cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned above, a very general result.  "
The electric field inside a cavity of any conductor is zero.  
All charges reside only on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.  
 -LRB- There are no charges placed in the cavity. -RRB-   
"The proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are omitted here, but we note their important implication.  "
This is known as electrostatic shielding.  
The effect can be made use of in protecting sensitive instruments from outside electrical influence.  
Figure 2.19 gives a summary of the important electrostatic properties of a conductor.  
Dielectrics are non-conducting substances.  
"In contrast to conductors, they have no  -LRB- or negligible number of -RRB-  charge carriers.  "
Recall from Section 2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an external electric field.  
The free charge carriers move and charge distribution in the conductor adjusts itself in such a way that the electric field due to induced charges opposes the external field within the conductor.  
"This happens until, in the static situation, the two fields cancel each other and the net electrostatic field in the conductor is zero.  "
"In a dielectric, this free movement of charges is not possible.  "
"Unlike in a conductor, however, the opposing field so induced does not exactly cancel the external field.  "
It only reduces it.  
The extent of the effect depends on the nature of the dielectric.  
"To understand the effect, we need to look at the charge distribution of a dielectric at the molecular level.  "
The molecules of a substance may be polar or non-polar.  
"In a non-polar molecule, the centres of positive and negative charges coincide.  "
The molecule then has no permanent  -LRB- or intrinsic -RRB-  dipole moment.  
"Examples of non-polar molecules are oxygen  -LRB- O2 -RRB-  and hydrogen  -LRB- H2 -RRB-  molecules which, because of their symmetry, have no dipole moment.  "
"On the other hand, a polar molecule is one in which the centres of positive and negative charges are separated  -LRB- even when there is no external field -RRB- .  "
Such molecules have a permanent dipole moment.  
An ionic molecule such as HCl or a molecule of water  -LRB- H2O -RRB-  are examples of polar molecules.  
"In an external electric field, the positive and negative charges of a non-polar molecule are displaced in opposite directions.  "
The displacement stops when the external force on the constituent charges of the molecule is balanced by the restoring force  -LRB- due to internal fields in the molecule -RRB- .  
The non-polar molecule thus develops an induced dipole moment.  
The dielectric is said to be polarised by the external field.  
We consider only the simple situation when the induced dipole moment is in the direction of the field and is proportional to the field strength.  
Substances for which this assumption is true are called linear isotropic dielectrics.  
The induced dipole moments of different molecules add up giving a net dipole moment of the dielectric in the presence of the external field.  
"A dielectric with polar molecules also develops a net dipole moment in an external field, but for a different reason.  "
"In the absence of any external field, the different permanent dipoles are oriented randomly due to thermal agitation; so the total dipole moment is zero.  "
"When an external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend to align with the field.  "
"When summed over all the molecules, there is then a net dipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is polarised.  "
"There may be, in addition, the 'induced dipole moment' effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment effect is more important for polar molecules.  "
"Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops a net dipole moment in the presence of an external field.  "
The dipole moment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P.  
"It is possible to relate χe to the molecular properties of the substance, but we shall not pursue that here.  "
The question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original external field inside it?  
"Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular dielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E0 parallel to two of its faces.  "
The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric.  
Thus every volume element ∆v of the slab has a dipole moment P ∆v in the direction of the field.  
The volume element ∆v is macroscopically small but contains a very large number of molecular dipoles.  
"Anywhere inside the dielectric, the volume element ∆v has no net charge  -LRB- though it has net dipole moment -RRB- .  "
"This is, because, the positive charge of one dipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.  "
"However, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the electric field, there is evidently a net charge density.  "
"As seen in Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain unneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at the left surface.  "
The unbalanced charges are the induced charges due to the external field.  
"Thus the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged surfaces with induced surface charge densities, say σp and —σp.  "
"Clearly, the field produced by these surface charges opposes the external field.  "
"The total field in the dielectric is, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric is present.  "
We should note that the surface charge density ± σp arises from bound  -LRB- not free charges -RRB-  in the dielectric.  
A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator.  
"The conductors have charges, say Q1 and Q2, and potentials V1 and V2.  "
"Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q and —Q, with potential difference V = V1 — V2 between them.  "
We shall consider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor.  
 -LRB- Even a single conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at infinity. -RRB-  ; The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the two terminals of a battery.  
"Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though this, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors — the total charge of the capacitor is zero.  "
The electric field in the region between the conductors is proportional to the charge Q.  
"That is, if the charge on the capacitor is, say doubled, the electric field will also be doubled at every point.  "
This follows from the direct proportionality between field and charge implied by Coulomb's law and the superposition principle.  
"Now, potential difference V is the work done per unit positive charge in taking a small test charge from the conductor 2 to 1 against the field.  "
"Consequently, V is also proportional to Q, and the ratio Q/V is a constant.  "
The constant C is called the capacitance of the capacitor.  
"C is independent of Q or V, as stated above ; The capacitance C depends only on the geometrical configuration  -LRB- shape, size, separation -RRB-  of the system of two conductors.  "
"As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the insulator  -LRB- dielectric -RRB-  separating the two conductors.  "
"Equation  -LRB- 2.38 -RRB-  shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q.  "
This means a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge Q at a relatively small V.  
This is of practical importance.  
High potential difference implies strong electric field around the conductors.  
"A strong electric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so produced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge on the capacitor plates, at least partly.  "
"In other words, the charge of the capacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the intervening medium.  "
The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand without break-down  -LRB- of its insulating property -RRB-  is called its dielectric strength; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm—1.  
"For a separation between conductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential difference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors.  "
"Put differently, there is a limit to the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without significant leaking.  "
A parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting plates separated by a small distance.  
We first take the intervening medium between the plates to be vacuum.  
The effect of a dielectric medium between the plates is discussed in the next section.  
Let A be the area of each plate and d the separation between them.  
The two plates have charges Q and —Q.  
"Since d is much smaller than the linear dimension of the plates  -LRB- d2  _LESS_LT;  _LESS_LT;  A -RRB- , we can use the result on electric field by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface charge density.  "
Plate 1 has surface charge density σ = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface charge density —σ.  
The direction of electric field is from the positive to the negative plate.  
"Thus, the electric field is localized between the two plates and is uniform throughout.  "
"For plates with finite area, this will not be true near the outer boundaries of the plates.  "
The field lines bend outward at the edges — an effect called 'fringing of the field'.  
"By the same token, σ will not be strictly uniform on the entire plate;  -LRB- E and σ are related by Eq.  -LRB- 2.35 -RRB- . -RRB-   "
"However, for d2  _LESS_LT;  _LESS_LT;  A, these effects can be ignored in the regions sufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq.  -LRB- 2.41 -RRB- .  "
"This shows that 1F is too big a unit in practice, as remarked earlier.  "
"With the understanding of the behavior of dielectrics in an external field developed in Section, let us see how the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is modified when a dielectric is present.  "
"As before, we have two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d.  "
"The charge on the plates is ±Q, corresponding to the charge density ±σ  -LRB- with σ = Q/A -RRB- .  "
Consider next a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupying the intervening region.  
The electric field in the dielectric then corresponds to the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is ±  -LRB- σ — σp -RRB- .  
"For linear dielectrics, we expect σp to be proportional to E0, i.e., to σ.  "
The dimensionless ratio ε is called the dielectric constant of the substance.  
"As remarked before, from Eq.  -LRB- 2.49 -RRB- , it is clear that K is greater than 1.  "
"We have introduced the notion of dielectric constant and arrived at Eq.  -LRB- 2.54 -RRB- , without giving the explicit relation between the induced charge density σp and the polarisation P.  "
"We can combine several capacitors of capacitance C1, C2,..., Cn to obtain a system with some effective capacitance C.  "
The effective capacitance depends on the way the individual capacitors are combined.  
"Imagine next a process of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by bit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge Q.  "
"By charge conservation, conductor 2 has charge —Q at the end.  "
"In transferring positive charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at any stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than conductor 2.  "
"To calculate the total work done, we first calculate the work done in a small step involving transfer of an infinitesimal  -LRB- i.e., vanishingly small -RRB-  amount of charge.  "
Consider the intermediate situation when the conductors 1 and 2 have charges Q′ and —Q′ respectively.  
"At this stage, the potential difference V′ between conductors 1 to 2 is Q′/C, where C is the capacitance of the system.  "
Next imagine that a small charge δQ′ is transferred from conductor 2 to 1.  
Total work done in charging the capacitor may be viewed as stored in the energy of electric field between the plates.  
Note that Ad is the volume of the region between the plates  -LRB- where electric field alone exists -RRB- .  
This is a machine that can build up high voltages of the order of a few million volts.  
"The principle underlying the machine is as follows ; Suppose we have a large spherical conducting shell of radius R, on which we place a charge Q.  "
This charge spreads itself uniformly all over the sphere.  
"So the potential outside is that of a point charge; and inside it is constant, namely the value at the radius R.  "
"Now, as shown in Fig. 2.32, let us suppose that in some way we introduce a small sphere of radius r, carrying some charge q, into the large one, and place it at the center.  "
Assume now that q is positive.  
The potential due to Q is constant upto radius R and so cancels out in the difference!  
"This means that if we now connect the smaller and larger sphere by a wire, the charge q on the former will immediately flow onto the matter, even though the charge Q may be quite large.  "
The natural tendency is for positive charge to move from higher to lower potential.  
"Thus, provided we are somehow able to introduce the small charged sphere into the larger one, we can in this way keep piling up larger and larger amount of charge on the latter.  "
This is the principle of the van de Graaff generator.  
"It is a machine capable of building up potential difference of a few million volts, and fields close to the breakdown field of air which is about 3 × 106 V/m.  "
A schematic diagram of the van de Graaff generator is given in Fig. 2.33.  
A large spherical conducting shell  -LRB- of few metres radius -RRB-  is supported at a height several meters above the ground on an insulating column.  
This belt is kept continuously moving by a motor driving the lower pulley.  
"It continuously carries positive charge, sprayed on to it by a brush at ground level, to the top.  "
There it transfers its positive charge to another conducting brush connected to the large shell.  
"Thus positive charge is transferred to the shell, where it spreads out uniformly on the outer surface.  "
"In this way, voltage differences of as much as 6 or 8 million volts  -LRB- with respect to ground -RRB-  can be built up.  "
FIGURE 2.33 Principle of construction of Van de Graaff generator.  
"﻿In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at rest.  "
Charges in motion constitute an electric current.  
Such currents occur naturally in many situations.  
"Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results.  "
"The flow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river.  "
A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices.  
"In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.  "
Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges.  
Both the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward across the area.  
"In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount  -LRB- i.e., forward minus backward -RRB-  of positive charge that flows in the forward direction across the area.  "
"Similarly, let q— be the net amount of negative charge flowing across the area in the forward direction.  "
"The net amount of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval t, then, is q = q+ — q—.  "
This is proportional to t for steady current and the quotient is defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction.  
" -LRB- If it turn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward direction. -RRB-   "
"Currents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define the current as follows.  "
"Let ∆Q be the net charge flowing across a cross-section of a conductor during the time interval ∆t  -LRB- i.e., between times t and  -LRB- t + ∆t -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
"Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the conductor is defined as the value of the ratio of ∆Q to ∆t in the limit of ∆t tending to zero.  "
"In SI units, the unit of current is ampere.  "
An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter.  
An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances.  
"An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes.  "
An electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied.  
"If it is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current.  "
"In nature, free charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the ionosphere.  "
"However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move.  "
"Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water, for example, contains approximately 1022 molecules.  "
These molecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached to individual nuclei.  
"In some materials, the electrons will still be bound, i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied.  "
"In other materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move within the bulk material.  "
"So, there will be no net electric current.  "
Let us now see what happens to such a piece of conductor if an electric field is applied.  
"To focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor in the shape of a cylinder of radius R  -LRB- Fig. 3.1 -RRB- .  "
Suppose we now take two thin circular discs of a dielectric of the same radius and put positive charge +Q distributed over one disc and similarly —Q at the other disc.  
We attach the two discs on the two flat surfaces of the cylinder.  
An electric field will be created and is directed from the positive towards the negative charge.  
The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards +Q.  
They will thus move to neutralise the charges.  
"The electrons, as long as they are moving, will constitute an electric current.  "
"Hence in the situation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no current thereafter.  "
We can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are supplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by electrons moving inside the conductor.  
"In that case, there will be a steady electric field in the body of the conductor ; This will result in a continuous current rather than a current for a short period of time.  "
"Mechanisms, which maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall study later in this chapter.  "
"In the next sections, we shall study the steady current that results from a steady electric field in conductors.  "
"A basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in 1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents was discovered.  "
Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing and let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.  
"Then Ohm's law states that V ∝ I or, V = RI, where the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the conductor.  "
"The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol Ω.  "
The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor but also on the dimensions of the conductor.  
The dependence of R on the dimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.  
Consider a conductor satisfying Eq.  -LRB- 3.3 -RRB-  to be in the form of a slab of length l and cross sectional area A.  
"Imagine placing two such identical slabs side by side, so that the length of the combination is 2l.  "
The current flowing through the combination is the same as that flowing through either of the slabs.  
The electrons will drift because of the electric field created to neutralise the charges.  
The current thus will stop after a while unless the charges +Q and —Q are continuously replenished.  
The potential difference across the ends of the combination is clearly sum of the potential difference across the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V.  
"Thus, doubling the length of a conductor doubles the resistance.  "
"In general, then resistance is proportional to length, R ∝ l.  "
"For a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current through the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing through each of the two half-slabs is I/2.  "
"Thus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles the resistance.  "
"In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.  "
ρ is called resistivity.  
"Current per unit area  -LRB- taken normal to the current -RRB- , I/A, is called current density and is denoted by j.  "
The SI units of the current density are A/m2.  
"Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the conductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its ends is El.  "
The above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in a vector form.  
"The current density,  -LRB- which we have defined as the current through unit area normal to the current -RRB-  is also directed along E, and is also a vector j  -LRB- ≡ jE/E -RRB- .  "
"Ohm's law is often stated in an equivalent form, Eq.  -LRB- 3.13 -RRB-  in addition to Eq.  -LRB- 3.3 -RRB- .  "
"In the next section, we will try to understand the origin of the Ohm's law as arising from the characteristics of the drift of electrons.  "
"As remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed ions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random directions.  "
"If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be zero since their directions are random.  "
Consider now the situation when an electric field is present.  
Consider again the ith electron at a given time t.  
"This electron would have had its last collision some time before t, and let ti be the time elapsed after its last collision.  "
The average velocity of the electrons at time t is the average of all the Vi's.  
The collisions of the electrons do not occur at regular intervals but at random times.  
"Let us denote by τ, the average time between successive collisions ; Then at a given time, some of the electrons would have spent time more than τ and some less than τ.  "
The average value of ti then is τ  -LRB- known as relaxation time -RRB- .  
This last result is surprising.  
"It tells us that the electrons move with an average velocity which is independent of time, although electrons are accelerated.  "
This is the phenomenon of drift and the velocity vd in Eq.  -LRB- 3.17 -RRB-  is called the drift velocity.  
"Because of the drift, there will be net transport of charges across any area perpendicular to E.  "
"Consider a planar area A, located inside the conductor such that the normal to the area is parallel to E.  "
"Then because of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time ∆t, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto -PIPE-vd-PIPE-∆t would have crossed the area.  "
"If n is the number of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then there are n ∆t-PIPE-vd-PIPE-A such electrons.  "
"Since each electron carries a charge —e, the total charge transported across this area A to the right in time ∆t is —ne A-PIPE-vd-PIPE-∆t.  "
E is directed towards the left and hence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of this.  
The magnitude of current density in a metal is the magnitude of charge contained in a cylinder of unit area and length vd.  
We thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction reproduces Ohm's law.  
"We have, of course, made assumptions that τ and n are constants, independent of E.  "
"We shall, in the next section, discuss the limitations of Ohm's law.  "
"As we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers.  "
"In metals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they are electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be both positive and negative ions.  "
An important quantity is the mobility µ defined as the magnitude of the drift velocity per unit electric field.  
The SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practical units  -LRB- cm2/Vs -RRB- .  
Mobility is positive.  
"Although Ohm's law has been found valid over a large class of materials, there do exist materials and devices used in electric circuits where the proportionality of V and I does not hold.  "
"In other words, if I is the current for a certain V, then reversing the direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not produce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction.  "
"This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study in Chapter 14.  "
"The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more than one value of V for the same current I.  "
Materials and devices not obeying Ohm's law in the form of Eq.  -LRB- 3.3 -RRB-  are actually widely used in electronic circuits.  
"In this and a few subsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in materials that obey Ohm's law.  "
The resistivities of various common materials are listed in Table 3.1.  
"The materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators depending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.  "
The solid line is the voltage V versus current I for a good conductor.  
Note the different scales for negative and positive values of the voltage and current.  
Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10—8Ωm to 10—6Ωm.  
"At the other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having resistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more.  "
In between the two are the semiconductors.  
"These, however, have resistivities characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature.  "
The resistivities of semiconductors are also affected by presence of small amount of impurities.  
This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for electronic devices.  
Commercially produced resistors for domestic use or in laboratories are of two major types: wire bound resistors and carbon resistors.  
"Wire bound resistors are made by winding the wires of an alloy, viz., manganin, constantan, nichrome or similar ones.  "
The choice of these materials is dictated mostly by the fact that their resistivities are relatively insensitive to temperature.  
These resistances are typically in the range of a fraction of an ohm to a few hundred ohms.  
Resistors in the higher range are made mostly from carbon.  
"Carbon resistors are compact, inexpensive and thus find extensive use in electronic circuits.  "
Carbon resistors are small in size and hence their values are given using a color code.  
The resistors have a set of co-axial colored rings on them whose significance are listed in Table 3.2.  
"At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph, however, deviates considerably from a straight line.  "
"Equation  -LRB- 3.26 -RRB-  thus, can be used approximately over a limited range of T around any reference temperature T0, where the graph can be approximated as a straight line.  "
"Some materials like Nichrome  -LRB- which is an alloy of nickel, iron and chromium -RRB-  exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature.  "
Manganin and constantan have similar properties.  
These materials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since their resistance values would change very little with temperatures.  
"Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with increasing temperatures.  "
A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.11.  
"We can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of resistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq.  -LRB- 3.23 -RRB- .  "
"As we increase temperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of current, increases resulting in more frequent collisions.  "
"The average time of collisions τ, thus decreases with temperature.  "
"In a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable extent and thus the decrease in the value of τ with rise in temperature causes ρ to increase as we have observed.  "
"For insulators and semiconductors, however, n increases with temperature.  "
"This increase more than compensates any decrease in τ in Eq.  -LRB- 3.23 -RRB-  so that for such materials, ρ decreases with temperature.  "
"If charges moved without collisions through the conductor, their kinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged.  "
Equation  -LRB- 3.33 -RRB-  has an important application to power transmission.  
"Electrical power is transmitted from power stations to homes and factories, which may be hundreds of miles away, via transmission cables.  "
Heat is produced in the resistor R which is connected across the terminals of a cell.  
The energy dissipated in the resistor R comes from the chemical energy of the electrolyte.  
One obviously wants to minimize the power loss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes and factories.  
We shall see now how this can be achieved.  
The connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite resistance Rc.  
"The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is wasted is Pc with Pc = I2Rc from Eq.  -LRB- 3.32 -RRB- .  "
"Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the connecting wires is inversely proportional to V2.  "
The transmission cables from power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance Rc is considerable.  
"Using electricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device called a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.  "
The current through a single resistor R across which there is a potential difference V is given by Ohm's law I = V/R.  
Resistors are sometimes joined together and there are simple rules for calculation of equivalent resistance of such combination.  
Two resistors are said to be in series if only one of their end points is joined.  
"If a third resistor is joined with the series combination of the two  -LRB- Fig. 3.14 -RRB- , then all three are said to be in series.  "
"Clearly, we can extend this definition to series combination of any number of resistors.  "
Two or more resistors are said to be in parallel if one end of all the resistors is joined together and similarly the other ends joined together.  
"Since current measures the rate of flow of charge, this means that the same current I flows through R1 and R2.  "
"By Ohm's law: Potential difference across R1 = V1 = IR1, and Potential difference across R2 = V2 = I2 ; The potential difference V across the combination is V1 + V2.  "
The equivalent resistance Req is Req = R1 + R2 +... + Rn.  
Consider now the parallel combination of two resistors.  
The charge that flows in at A from the left flows out partly through R1 and partly through R2.  
"The currents I, I1, I2 shown in the figure are the rates of flow of charge at the points indicated.  "
We can reason similarly for any number of resistors in parallel.  
"Consider for example, the circuit in Fig.  -LRB- 3.17 -RRB- , where there are three resistors R1, R2 and R3.  "
We have already mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady current in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell.  
"Basically a cell has two electrodes, called the positive  -LRB- P -RRB-  and the negative  -LRB- N -RRB- , as shown in Fig. 3.18.  "
They are immersed in an electrolytic solution.  
"Dipped in the solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte.  "
The positive electrode has a potential difference V+  -LRB- V+  _GREAT_GT;  0 -RRB-  between itself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked A in the figure.  
"Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative potential — -LRB- V— -RRB-   -LRB- V— ≥ 0 -RRB-  relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it, marked as B in the figure.  "
"The name emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was given at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.  "
"To understand the significance of ε, consider a resistor R connected across the cell  -LRB- Fig. 3.18 -RRB- .  "
"If however R is finite, I is not zero.  "
The gap between the electrodes is exaggerated for clarity.  
"A and B are points in the electrolyte typically close to P and N.  -LRB- b -RRB-  the symbol for a cell, + referring to P and — referring to the N electrode.  "
Electrical connections to the cell are made at P and N.  
In olden days lightning was considered as an atmospheric flash of supernatural origin.  
It was believed to be the great weapon of Gods.  
But today the phenomenon of lightning can be explained scientifically by elementary principles of physics.  
Atmospheric electricity arises due to the separation of electric charges.  
In the ionosphere and magnetosphere strong electric current is generated from the solar-terrestrial interaction.  
In the lower atmosphere the current is weaker and is maintained by thunderstorm.  
"There are ice particles in the clouds, which grow, collide, fracture and break apart.  "
The smaller particles acquire positive charge and the larger ones negative charge.  
These charged particles get separated by updrafts in the clouds and gravity.  
"The upper portion of the cloud becomes positively charged and the middle negatively charged, leading to dipole structure.  "
Sometimes a very weak positive charge is found near the base of the cloud.  
The ground is positively charged at the time of thunderstorm development.  
Also cosmic and radioactive radiations ionise air into positive and negative ions and air becomes  -LRB- weakly -RRB-  electrically conductive.  
The separation of charges produce tremendous amount of electrical potential within the cloud as well as between the cloud and ground.  
This can amount to millions of volts and eventually the electrical resistance in the air breaks down and lightning flash begins and thousands of amperes of current flows.  
The electric field is of the order of 105 V/m.  
A lightning flash is composed of a series of strokes with an average of about four and the duration of each flash is about 30 seconds.  
The average peak power per stroke is about 1012 watts.  
During fair weather also there is charge in the atmosphere.  
The surface charge density at ground is negative; the electric field is directed downward.  
"Over land the average electric field is about 120 V/m, which corresponds to a surface charge density of —1.2×10—9 C/m2.  "
"Over the entire earth's surface, the total negative charge amount to about 600 kC.  "
An equal positive charge exists in the atmosphere.  
This electric field is not noticeable in daily life.  
"The reason why it is not noticed is that virtually everything, including our bodies, is conductor compared to air.  "
"Like resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit.  "
"And like resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit, replace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.  "
"Consider first two cells in series  -LRB- Fig. 3.20 -RRB- , where one terminal of the two cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free.  "
"ε1, ε2 are the emf's of the two cells and r1, r2 their internal resistances, respectively.  "
"Let V -LRB- A -RRB- , V -LRB- B -RRB- , V -LRB- C -RRB-  be the potentials at points A, B and C shown in Fig. 3.20.  "
Then V -LRB- A -RRB- —V -LRB- B -RRB-  is the potential difference between the positive and negative terminals of the first cell.  
"In Fig.3.20, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to the positive electrode of the second.  "
"This is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive electrode.  "
"Next, consider a parallel combination of the cells.  "
I1 and I2 are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the cells.  
"At the point B1, I1 and I2 flow in whereas the current I flows out.  "
"Since as much charge flows in as out, we have I = I1 + I2.  "
"Let V -LRB- B1 -RRB-  and V -LRB- B2 -RRB-  be the potentials at B1 and B2, respectively.  "
Electric circuits generally consist of a number of resistors and cells interconnected sometimes in a complicated way.  
The formulae we have derived earlier for series and parallel combinations of resistors are not always sufficient to determine all the currents and potential differences in the circuit.  
"Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules, are very useful for analysis of electric circuits.  "
"Given a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a symbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows along the resistor in the direction indicated.  "
"If ultimately I is determined to be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the arrow.  "
"If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction opposite to the arrow.  "
"Similarly, for each source  -LRB- i.e., cell or some other source of electrical power -RRB-  the positive and negative electrodes are labeled as well as a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through the cell.  "
"If, while labeling the current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course V = ε + I r.  "
"The proof of this rule follows from the fact that when currents are steady, there is no accumulation of charges at any junction or at any point in a line.  "
"Thus, the total current flowing in,  -LRB- which is the rate at which charge flows into the junction -RRB- , must equal the total current flowing out.  "
 -LRB- b -RRB-  Loop rule: The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed loop involving resistors and cells in the loop is zero.  
"This rule is also obvious, since electric potential is dependent on the location of the point.  "
"Thus starting with any point if we come back to the same point, the total change must be zero.  "
"In a closed loop, we do come back to the starting point and hence the rule.  "
At junction a the current leaving is I1 + I2 and current entering is I3.  
The junction rule says I3 = I1 + I2 ; At point h current entering is I1.  
There is only one current leaving h and by junction rule that will also be I1.  
This will be illustrated in Example 3.7.  
"As an application of Kirchhoff's rules consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.25, which is called the Wheatstone bridge.  "
"The bridge has four resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4.  "
Across one pair of diagonally opposite points  -LRB- A and C in the figure -RRB-  a source is connected.  
"This  -LRB- i.e., AC -RRB-  is called the battery arm.  "
"Between the other two vertices, B and D, a galvanometer G  -LRB- which is a device to detect currents -RRB-  is connected.  "
"This line, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.  "
"For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance.  "
"In general there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a current Ig through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge where the resistors are such that Ig = 0.  "
"Next, we apply Kirchhoff's loop rule to closed loops ADBA and CBDC.  "
The Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical method for determination of an unknown resistance.  
"Let us suppose we have an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R4 is thus not known.  "
"Keeping known resistances R1 and R2 in the first and second arm of the bridge, we go on varying R3 till the galvanometer shows a null deflection.  "
A practical device using this principle is called the meter bridge.  
It will be discussed in the next section.  
The meter bridge is shown in Fig. 3.27.  
"It consists of a wire of length 1m and of uniform cross sectional area stretched taut and clamped between two thick metallic strips bent at right angles, as shown.  "
The metallic strip has two gaps across which resistors can be connected.  
The end points where the wire is clamped are connected to a cell through a key.  
One end of a galvanometer is connected to the metallic strip midway between the two gaps.  
The other end of the galvanometer is connected to a 'jockey'.  
The jockey is essentially a metallic rod whose one end has a knife-edge which can slide over the wire to make electrical connection.  
R is an unknown resistance whose value we want to determine.  
It is connected across one of the gaps.  
R is a resistance to be measured and S is a standard resistance ; standard known resistance S.  
"The jockey is connected to some point D on the wire, a distance l cm from the end A.  "
The jockey can be moved along the wire.  
"The portion AD of the wire has a resistance Rcml, where Rcm is the resistance of the wire per unit centimetre.  "
The portion DC of the wire similarly has  a resistance Rcm  -LRB- 100 - l -RRB- .  
"Thus, once we have found out l1, the unknown resistance R is known in terms of the standard known resistance S.  "
"By choosing various values of S, we would get various values of l1, and calculate R each time.  "
An error in measurement of l1 would naturally result in an error in R.  
This is a versatile instrument.  
"It is basically a long piece of uniform wire, sometimes a few meters in length across which a standard cell is connected.  "
"In actual design, the wire is sometimes cut in several pieces placed side by side and connected at the ends by thick metal strip.  "
"In the figure, the wires run from A to C. The small vertical portions are the thick metal strips connecting the various sections of the wire.  "
A current I flows through the wire which can be varied by a variable resistance  -LRB- rheostat -RRB-  in the circuit 
Using Eq.  -LRB- 3.95 -RRB-  we can find the internal resistance of a given cell.  
The potentiometer has the advantage that it draws no current from the voltage source being measured.  
As such it is unaffected by the internal resistance of the source.  
Both Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000 years.  
"However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was realized that they were intimately related.  "
He investigated this phenomenon.  
He found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which has the straight wire as its center and has its plane perpendicular to the wire.  
This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
It is noticeable when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the earth's magnetic field may be ignored.  
Reversing the direction of the current reverses the orientation of the needle.  
The deflection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the wire.  
Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in concentric circles with the wire as the center.  
Oersted concluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field in the surrounding space.  
Following this there was intense experimentation.  
"In 1864, the laws obeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by James Maxwell who then realized that light was electromagnetic waves.  "
"Radio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by J.C. Bose and G. Marconi by the end of the 19th century.  "
A remarkable scientific and technological progress has taken place in the 20th century.  
"This is due to our increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of devices for production, amplification, transmission and detection of electromagnetic waves.  "
"In this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts forces on moving charged particles, like electrons, protons, and current-carrying wires.  "
We shall also learn how currents produce magnetic fields.  
We shall see how particles can be accelerated to very high energies in a cyclotron.  
We shall study how currents and voltages are detected by a galvanometer.  
A current or a field going into the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross  -LRB- ⊗ -RRB- .  
"The charge Q, the source of the field, produces an electric field E.  "
The wire is perpendicular to the plane of the paper.  
A ring of compass needles surrounds the wire.  
The field at a particular point can be due to one or more charges.  
If there are more charges the fields add vectorially.  
You have already learned in Chapter 1 that this is called the principle of superposition.  
"Once the field is known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq.  -LRB- 4.2 -RRB- .  "
It has several basic properties identical to the electric field.  
It is defined at each point in space  -LRB- and can in addition depend on time -RRB- .  
"Experimentally, it is found to obey the principle of superposition: the magnetic field of several sources is the vector addition of magnetic field of each individual source.  "
The force on an electric charge q due to both of them can be written as F = q -LRB- E -LRB- r -RRB-  + v × B -LRB- r -RRB-  -RRB-  ≡ Felectric + Fmagnetic.  
This force was given first by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive experiments of Ampere and others.  
It is called the Lorentz force.  
You have already studied in detail the force due to the electric field.  
"If we look at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the following features ;  -LRB- i -RRB-  It depends on q, v and B  -LRB- charge of the particle, the velocity and the magnetic field -RRB- .  "
Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a positive charge.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  The magnetic force q -LRB- v × B -RRB-  includes a vector product of velocity and magnetic field.  
The vector product makes the force due to magnetic field vanish  -LRB- become zero -RRB-  if velocity and magnetic field are parallel or anti-parallel.  
The force acts in a  -LRB- sideways -RRB-  direction perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field.  
Its direction is given by the screw rule or right hand rule for vector  -LRB- or cross -RRB-  product as illustrated in Fig. 4.2.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  The magnetic force is zero if charge is not moving  -LRB- as then -PIPE-v-PIPE- = 0 -RRB- .  
Only a moving charge feels the magnetic force.  
"The magnitude of magnetic field B is 1 SI unit, when the force acting on a unit charge  -LRB- 1 C -RRB- , moving perpendicular to B with a speed 1m/s, is one newton.  "
"Dimensionally, we have  -LRB- B -RRB-  =  -LRB- F/qv -RRB-  and the unit of B are Newton second/ -LRB- coulomb metre -RRB- .  "
This unit is called tesla  -LRB- T -RRB-  named after Nikola Tesla  -LRB- 1856 — 1943 -RRB- .  
Tesla is a rather large unit.  
Equation  -LRB- 4.4 -RRB-  holds for a straight rod.  
"In this equation, B is the external magnetic field.  "
It is not the field produced by the current-carrying rod.  
This summation can be converted to an integral in most cases.  
"We write it as F = Gm1 m2/r2, where G is the universal constant of gravitation.  "
"Similarly in Coulomb's law of el ectrostatics we write the force between two point charges q1, q2, separated by a distance r as F = kq1 q2/r2 where k is a constant of proportionality.  "
"In SI units, k is taken as 1/4 πε where ε is the permittivity of the medium.  "
"Also in magnetism, we get another constant, which in SI units, is taken as µ/4π where µ is the permeability of the medium.  "
"Although G, ε and µ arise as proportionality constants, there is a difference between gravitational force and electromagnetic force.  "
"While the gravitational force does not depend on the intervening medium, the electromagnetic force depends on the medium between the two charges or magnets.  "
"Hence while G is a universal constant, ε and µ depend on the medium.  "
They have different values for different media.  
The product εµ turns out to be related to the speed v of electromagnetic radiation in the medium through εµ =1/v2.  
Electric permittivity ε is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects and is affected by a medium.  
"It is determined by the ability of a material to polarise in response to an applied field, and thereby to cancel, partially, the field inside the material.  "
"Similarly, magnetic permeability µ is the ability of a substance to acquire magnetisation in magnetic fields.  "
It is a measure of the extent to which magnetic field can penetrate matter.  
"We will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in a magnetic field.  "
"In the case of motion of a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.  "
So no work is done and no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced  -LRB- though the direction of momentum may be changed -RRB- .  
"Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE, which can have a component parallel  -LRB- or antiparallel -RRB-  to motion and thus can transfer energy in addition to momentum.  "
We shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field.  
First consider the case of v perpendicular to B.  
"The perpendicular force, qv × B, acts as a centripetal force and produces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.  "
The particle will describe a circle if v and B are perpendicular to each other.  
"If velocity has a component along B, this component remains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will not be affected by the magnetic field.  "
"The motion in a plane perpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing a helical motion.  "
"If the velocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field B, the magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B and acts like a centripetal force ; It has a magnitude qvB.  "
"The larger the momentum, the larger is the radius and bigger the circle described.  "
"If ω is the angular frequency, then v = ωr ; So, ω = 2πν = qB/m which is independent of the velocity or energy.  "
Here ν is the frequency of rotation.  
The independence of ν from energy has important application in the design of a cyclotron  -LRB- see Section 4.4.2 -RRB- .  
The distance moved along the magnetic field in one rotation is called pitch p.  
The radius of the circular component of motion is called the radius of the helix.  
"In polar regions like Alaska and Northern Canada, a splendid display of colors is seen in the sky.  "
"The appearance of dancing green pink lights is fascinating, and equally puzzling.  "
"An explanation of this natural phenomenon is now found in physics, in terms of what we have studied here.  "
"Consider a charged particle of mass m and charge q, entering a region of magnetic field B with an initial velocity v.  "
Let this velocity have a component vp parallel to the magnetic field and a component vn normal to it.  
There is no force on a charged particle in the direction of the field.  
Hence the particle continues to travel with the velocity vp parallel to the field.  
The normal component vn of the particle results in a Lorentz force  -LRB- vn × B -RRB-  which is perpendicular to both vn and B.  
As seen in Section 4.3.1 the particle thus has a tendency to perform a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.  
"When this is coupled with the velocity parallel to the field, the resulting trajectory will be a helix along the magnetic field line, as shown in Figure  -LRB- a -RRB-  here.  "
"Even if the field line bends, the helically moving particle is trapped and guided to move around the field line.  "
"Since the Lorentz force is normal to the velocity of each point, the field does no work on the particle and the magnitude of velocity remains the same.  "
"During a solar flare, a large number of electrons and protons are ejected from the sun.  "
Some of them get trapped in the earth's magnetic field and move in helical paths along the field lines.  
The field lines come closer to each other near the magnetic poles.  
Hence the density of charges increases near the poles.  
These particles collide with atoms and molecules of the atmosphere.  
Excited oxygen atoms emit green light and excited nitrogen atoms emits pink light.  
This phenomenon is called Aurora Boriolis in physics.  
"We shall consider the simple case in which electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, as shown in Fig. 4.7.  "
"Thus, electric and magnetic forces are in opposite directions as shown in the figure.  "
This condition can be used to select charged particles of a particular velocity out of a beam containing charges moving with different speeds  -LRB- irrespective of their charge and mass -RRB- .  
"The crossed E and B fields, therefore, serve as a velocity selector.  "
Only particles with speed E/B pass undeflected through the region of crossed fields.  
This method was employed by J. J. Thomson in 1897 to measure the charge to mass ratio  -LRB- e/m -RRB-  of an electron.  
"The principle is also employed in Mass Spectrometer — a device that separates charged particles, usually ions, according to their charge to mass ratio.  "
The cyclotron is a machine to accelerate charged particles or ions to high energies.  
It was invented by E.O. Lawrence and M.S. Livingston in 1934 to investigate nuclear structure.  
The cyclotron uses both electric and magnetic fields in combination to increase the energy of charged particles.  
As the fields are perpendicular to each other they are called crossed fields.  
Cyclotron uses the fact that the frequency of revolution of the charged particle in a magnetic field is independent of its energy.  
Figure 4.8 shows a schematic view of the cyclotron.  
Inside the metal boxes the particle is shielded and is not acted on by the electric field.  
"The magnetic field, however, acts on the particle and makes it go round in a circular path inside a dee.  "
Every time the particle moves from one dee to another it is acted upon by the electric field.  
The sign of the electric field is changed alternately in tune with the circular motion of the particle.  
This ensures that the particle is always accelerated by the electric field.  
Each time the acceleration increases the energy of the particle.  
"As energy increases, the radius of the circular path increases.  "
So the path is a spiral one.  
The whole assembly is evacuated to minimize collisions between the ions and the air molecules.  
A high frequency alternating voltage is applied to the dees.  
"In the sketch shown in Fig. 4.8, positive ions or positively charged particles  -LRB- e.g., protons -RRB-  are released at the center P.   "
They move in a semi-circular path in one of the dees and arrive in the gap between the dees in a time interval T/2.  
This frequency is called the cyclotron frequency for obvious reasons and is denoted by νc.  
The frequency νa of the applied voltage is adjusted so that the polarity of the dees is reversed in the same time that it takes the ions to complete one half of the revolution.  
The requirement νa = νc is called the resonance condition.  
"The phase of the supply is adjusted so that when the positive ions arrive at the edge of D1, D2 is at a lower potential and the ions are accelerated across the gap.  "
Inside the dees the particles travel in a region free of the electric field.  
The increase in their kinetic energy is qV each time they cross from one dee to another  -LRB- V refers to the voltage across the dees at that time -RRB- .  
"From Eq.  -LRB- 4.5 -RRB- , it is clear that the radius of their path goes on increasing each time their kinetic energy increases.  "
The ions are repeatedly accelerated across the dees until they have the required energy to have a radius approximately that of the dees.  
They are then deflected by a magnetic field and leave the system via an exit slit.  
"R is the radius of the trajectory at exit, and equals the radius of a dee.  "
The operation of the cyclotron is based on the fact that the time for one revolution of an ion is independent of its speed or radius of its orbit.  
"The cyclotron is used to bombard nuclei with energetic particles, so accelerated by it, and study the resulting nuclear reactions.  "
The ions are eventually 'extracted' at the exit port.  
It is also used to implant ions into solids and modify their properties or even synthesise new materials.  
It is used in hospitals to produce radioactive substances which can be used in diagnosis and treatment.  
India has been an early entrant in the area of accelerator-based research.  
"The vision of Dr. Meghnath Saha created a 37"" Cyclotron in the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata in 1953.  "
"One 66 cm Cyclotron donated by the Rochester University of USA was commissioned in Panjab University, Chandigarh.  "
"A small electron accelerator was also established in University of Pune, Pune.  "
All magnetic fields that we know are due to currents  -LRB- or moving charges -RRB-  and due to intrinsic magnetic moments of particles.  
We call µ0 the permeability of free space  -LRB- or vacuum -RRB- .  
The Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field has certain similarities as well as differences with the Coulomb's law for the electrostatic field.  
"Some of these are:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of distance from the source to the point of interest.  "
"The principle of superposition applies to both fields ;  -LRB- In this connection, note that the magnetic field is linear in the source Idl just as the electrostatic field is linear in its source: the electric charge -RRB- .  "
The sense of dl×r is also given by the Right Hand Screw rule: Look at the plane containing vectors dl and r.  
Imagine moving from the first vector towards second vector.  
"If the movement is anticlockwise, the resultant is towards you.  "
"If it is clockwise, the resultant is away from you.  "
The current element Idl produces a field dB at a distance r.  
The ⊗ sign indicates that the field is perpendicular to the plane of this page and directed into it.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the source and the field point ; The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane containing the displacement vector r and the current element Idl.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not present in the electrostatic case.  
"In Fig. 4.9, the magnetic field at any point in the direction of dl  -LRB- the dashed line -RRB-  is zero.  "
"Along this line, θ = 0, sin θ = 0 and from Eq.  -LRB- 4.11 -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- , -PIPE-dB-PIPE- = 0.  "
We will discuss this connection further in Chapter 8 on the electromagnetic waves.  
"Since the speed of light in vacuum is constant, the product µ0ε0 is fixed in magnitude.  "
"Choosing the value of either ε0 or µ0, fixes the value of the other.  "
"In SI units, µ0 is fixed to be equal to 4π × 10—7 in magnitude.  "
"In the next section, we shall use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field due to a circular loop.  "
"In this section, we shall evaluate the magnetic field due to a circular coil along its axis.  "
The evaluation entails summing up the effect of infinitesimal current elements  -LRB- Idl -RRB-  mentioned in the previous section.  
"We assume that the current I is steady and that the evaluation is carried out in free space  -LRB- i.e., vacuum -RRB- .  "
Figure 4.11 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady current I.  
The x-axis is the axis of the loop.  
We wish to calculate the magnetic field at the point P on this axis ; Let x be the distance of P from the center O of the loop.  
Consider a conducting element dl of the loop ; This is shown in Fig. 4.11.  
"Further, any element of the loop will be perpendicular to the displacement vector from the element to the axial point.  "
"For example, the element dl in Fig. 4.11 is in the y-z plane whereas the displacement vector r from dl to the axial point P is in the x-y plane.  "
The direction of dB is shown in Fig. 4.11.  
It is perpendicular to the plane formed by dl and r.  
"When the components perpendicular to the x-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result.  "
"For example, the dB⊥ component due to dl is canceled by the contribution due to the diametrically opposite dl element, shown in Fig. 4.11.  "
"Thus, only the x-component survives.  "
The net contribution along x-direction can be obtained by integrating dBx = dB cos θ over the loop.  
"The summation of elements dl over the loop yields 2πR, the circumference of the loop.  "
"As a special case of the above result, we may obtain the field at the center of the loop.  "
The magnetic field lines due to a circular wire form closed loops and are shown in Fig. 4.12.  
FIGURE 4.12 The magnetic field lines for a current loop.  
The direction of the field is given by the right-hand thumb rule described in the text.  
The upper side of the loop may be thought of as the north pole and the lower side as the south pole of a magnet.  
There is an alternative and appealing way in which the Biot-Savart law may be expressed.  
Ampere's circuital law considers an open surface with a boundary.  
The surface has current passing through it.  
We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small line elements.  
Consider one such element of length dl.  
"We take the value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, B t, at this element and multiply it by the length of that element dl.  "
All such products are added together.  
We consider the limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number gets larger.  
The sum then tends to an integral.  
"Notice now, in Fig. 4.1 -LRB- c -RRB- , the iron filings form concentric circles.  "
These lines called magnetic field lines form closed loops.  
This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originate from positive charges and end at negative charges.  
The expression for the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoretical justification to Oersted's experiments.  
"Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is infinite, the field due to it at a nonzero distance is not infinite.  "
It tends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire.  
The field is directly proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the  -LRB- infinitely long -RRB-  current source.  
There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field due to a long wire.  
"This rule, called the right-hand rule, is: Grasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing in the direction of the current.  "
Your fingers will curl around in the direction of the magnetic field.  
Ampere's circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.  
"Both relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same physical consequences of a steady electrical current.  "
"Ampere's law is to Biot-Savart law, what Gauss's law is to Coulomb's law.  "
We also note that Ampere's circuital law holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time.  
The following example will help us understand what is meant by the term enclosed current.  
Fingers and thumb play different roles in the two.  
"It should be noted that while Ampere's circuital law holds for any loop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in every case.  "
"However, there exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law can be conveniently applied.  "
We shall use it in the next section to calculate the magnetic field produced by two commonly used and very useful magnetic systems: the solenoid and the toroid.  
The solenoid and the toroid are two pieces of equipment which generate magnetic fields.  
The television uses the solenoid to generate magnetic fields needed.  
The synchrotron uses a combination of both to generate the high magnetic fields required.  
"In both, solenoid and toroid, we come across a situation of high symmetry where Ampere's law can be conveniently applied.  "
We shall discuss a long solenoid.  
By long solenoid we mean that the solenoid's length is large compared to its radius.  
It consists of a long wire wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely spaced.  
So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop.  
The net magnetic field is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns.  
Enamelled wires are used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.  
Figure 4.17 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid.  
We show a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.17 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"In Fig. 4.17 -LRB- b -RRB- , we see that the field at the interior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.  "
The field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the axis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component.  
As the solenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.  
Figure 4.18 represents this idealised picture.  
The field inside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.  
The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has been stretched out for clarity.  
Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown.  
Notice how the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.  
Consider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd.  
Along cd the field is zero as argued above.  
"Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component is zero.  "
"Thus, these two sections make no contribution.  "
"Let the field along ab be B ; Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h.  "
"Let n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number of turns is nh.  "
"The enclosed current is, Ie = I -LRB- nh -RRB- , where I is the current in the solenoid.  "
The direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule.  
The solenoid is commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field.  
We shall see in the next chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft iron core inside the solenoid.  
The toroid is a hollow circular ring on which a large number of turns of a wire are closely wound.  
It can be viewed as a solenoid which has been bent into a circular shape to close on itself.  
It is shown in Fig. 4.19 -LRB- a -RRB-  carrying a current I.  
We shall see that the magnetic field in the open space inside  -LRB- point P -RRB-  and exterior to the toroid  -LRB- point Q -RRB-  is zero.  
The field B inside the toroid is constant in magnitude for the ideal toroid of closely wound turns.  
Figure 4.19 -LRB- b -RRB-  shows a sectional view of the toroid.  
The direction of the magnetic field inside is clockwise as per the right-hand thumb rule for circular loops.  
"Three circular Amperian loops 1, 2 and 3 are shown by dashed lines.  "
"By symmetry, the magnetic field should be tangential to each of them and constant in magnitude for a given loop.  "
The circular areas bounded by loops 2 and 3 both cut the toroid: so that each turn of current carrying wire is cut once by the loop 2 and twice by the loop 3.  
Let the magnetic field along loop 1 be B1 in magnitude.  
"Thus, the magnetic field at any point P in the open space inside the toroid is zero.  "
We shall now show that magnetic field at Q is likewise zero.  
Let the magnetic field along loop 3 be B3.  
"However, from the sectional cut, we see that the current coming out of the plane of the paper is canceled exactly by the current going into it.  "
Let the magnetic field inside the solenoid be B.  
We shall now consider the magnetic field at S.  
Once again we employ Ampere's law in the form of Eq.  -LRB- 4.17 -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  
The current enclosed Ie is  -LRB- for N turns of toroidal coil -RRB-  NI.  
The magnetic field can be obtained at an arbitrary distance r from the center O of the toroid by Ampere's circuital law.  
"The dashed lines labeled 1, 2 and 3 are three circular Amperian loops.  "
We shall now compare the two results: for a toroid and solenoid.  
We re-express Eq.  -LRB- 4.21 -RRB-  to make the comparison easier with the solenoid result given in Eq.  -LRB- 4.20 -RRB- .  
Let r be the average radius of the toroid and n be the number of turns per unit length.  
In an ideal toroid the coils are circular.  
In reality the turns of the toroidal coil form a helix and there is always a small magnetic field external to the toroid.  
We have seen in Section 4.3  -LRB- see also the box on helical motion of charged particles earlier in this chapter -RRB-  that orbits of charged particles are helical.  
"We consider two solenoids at a distance from each other, enclosed in an evacuated container  -LRB- see figure below where we have not shown the container -RRB- .  "
Charged particles moving in the region between the two solenoids will start with a small radius.  
The radius will increase as field decreases and the radius will decrease again as field due to the second solenoid takes over.  
The solenoids act as a mirror or reflector ;  -LRB- See the direction of F as the particle approaches coil 2 in the figure -RRB- .  
It has a horizontal component against the forward motion.  
This makes the particles turn back when they approach the solenoid.  
Such an arrangement will act like magnetic bottle or magnetic container.  
The particles will never touch the sides of the container.  
Such magnetic bottles are of great use in confining the high energy plasma in fusion experiments.  
The plasma will destroy any other form of material container because of it's high temperature.  
Another useful container is a toroid.  
"Toroids are expected to play a key role in the tokamak, an equipment for plasma confinement in fusion power reactors.  "
"There is an international collaboration called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor  -LRB- ITER -RRB- , being set up in France, for achieving controlled fusion, of which India is a collaborating nation.  "
We have learned that there exists a magnetic field due to a conductor carrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart law.  
"Further, we have learned that an external magnetic field will exert a force on a current-carrying conductor.  "
This follows from the Lorentz force formula.  
"Thus, it is logical to expect that two current-carrying conductors placed near each other will exert  -LRB- magnetic -RRB-  forces on each other.  "
"In the period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this magnetic force and its dependence on the magnitude of the current, on the shape and size of the conductors as well as the distances between the conductors.  "
"In this section, we shall take the simple example of two parallel current-carrying conductors, which will perhaps help us to appreciate Ampere's painstaking work.  "
"Figure 4.20 shows two long parallel conductors a and b separated by a distance d and carrying  -LRB- parallel -RRB-  currents Ia and Ib, respectively.  "
"The conductor 'a' produces, the same magnetic field Ba at all points along the conductor 'b'.  "
The right-hand rule tells us that the direction of this field is downwards  -LRB- when the conductors are placed horizontally -RRB- .  
The conductor 'b' carrying a current Ib will experience a sideways force due to the field Ba.  
The direction of this force is towards the conductor 'a'.  
"We label this force as Fba, the force on a segment L of 'b' due to 'a'.  "
Two long straight parallel conductors carrying steady currents Ia and Ib and separated by a distance d.  
Ba is the magnetic field set up by conductor 'a' at conductor 'b'.  
It is of course possible to compute the force on 'a' due to 'b'.  
"From considerations similar to above we can find the force Fab, on a segment of length L of 'a' due to the current in 'b'.  "
"It is equal in magnitude to Fba, and directed towards 'b'.  "
Note that this is consistent with Newton's third Law.  
"Thus, at least for parallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the Biot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with Newton's third Law.  "
We have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction attract each other.  
One can show that oppositely directed currents repel each other.  
"Thus, Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.  "
This rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics.  
Let fba represent the magnitude of the force Fba per unit length.  
"The above expression is used to define the ampere  -LRB- A -RRB- , which is one of the seven SI base units.  "
This definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946.  
It is a theoretical definition.  
In practice one must eliminate the effect of the earth's magnetic field and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate geometries.  
An instrument called the current balance is used to measure this mechanical force.  
"The SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in terms of the ampere.  "
"When a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of charge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb  -LRB- 1C -RRB- .  "
"It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges in motion, Newton's third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or conductors.  "
An essential consequence of the Newton's third law in mechanics is conservation of momentum of an isolated system.  
"This, however, holds even for the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided the momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.  "
Magnetic effects are generally smaller than electric effects.  
"As a consequence, the force between currents is rather small, because of the smallness of the factor µ.  "
Hence it is difficult to demonstrate attraction or repulsion between currents.  
"Thus for 5 A current in each wire at a separation of 1cm, the force per metre would be 5 × 10—4 N, which is about 50 mg weight.  "
It would be like pulling a wire by a string going over a pulley to which a 50 mg weight is attached.  
The displacement of the wire would be quite unnoticeable.  
"With the use of a soft spring, we can increase the effective length of the parallel current and by using mercury, we can make the displacement of even a few mm observable very dramatically.  "
You will also need a constant-current supply giving a constant current of about 5 A.  
Take a soft spring whose natural period of oscillations is about 0.5 — 1s.  
"Hang it vertically and attach a pointed tip to its lower end, as shown in the figure here.  "
Take some mercury in a dish and adjust the spring such that the tip is just above the mercury surface.  
"Take the DC current source, connect one of its terminals to the upper end of the spring, and dip the other terminal in mercury.  "
"If the tip of the spring touches mercury, the circuit is completed through mercury.  "
Let the DC source be put off to begin with.  
Let the tip be adjusted so that it just touches the mercury surface.  
"Switch on the constant current supply, and watch the fascinating outcome.  "
Similarly it exerts a force F2 on the arm CD and F2 is directed out of the plane of the paper.  
"Thus, the net force on the loop is zero.  "
There is a torque on the loop due to the pair of forces F1 and F2.  
Figure 4.21 -LRB- b -RRB-  shows a view of the loop from the AD end.  
It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate it anti-clockwise.  
"We next consider the case when the plane of the loop, is not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle with it.  "
Figure 4.22 illustrates this general case.  
"The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA.  "
"Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net force or torque.  "
The forces on arms AB and CD are F1 and F2.  
"They too are equal and opposite, with magnitude, But they are not collinear!  "
This results in a couple as before.  
"The torque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was along the magnetic field.  "
This is because the perpendicular distance between the forces of the couple has decreased.  
Figure 4.22 -LRB- b -RRB-  is a view of the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forces constituting a couple.  
This makes the forces collinear and the net force and torque zero.  
The torques in Eqs.  -LRB- 4.26 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 4.27 -RRB-  can be expressed as vector product of the magnetic moment of the coil and the magnetic field.  
"From Eq.  -LRB- 4.29 -RRB- , we see that the torque τ vanishes when m is either parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field B.  "
This indicates a state of equilibrium as there is no torque on the coil  -LRB- this also applies to any object with a magnetic moment m -RRB- .  
The area vector of the loop ABCD makes an arbitrary angle θ with the magnetic field.  
The forces F1 and F2 acting on the arms AB and CD are indicated.  
In Chapter 12 we shall read about the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.  
"In the Bohr model, the electron  -LRB- a negatively charged particle -RRB-  revolves around a positively charged nucleus much as a planet revolves around the sun.  "
The force in the former case is electrostatic  -LRB- Coulomb force -RRB-  while it is gravitational for the planet-Sun case.  
We show this Bohr picture of the electron in Fig. 4.23.  
"This constitutes a current I, where,  -LRB- 4.32 -RRB-  and T is the time period of revolution.  "
"There will be a magnetic moment, usually denoted by µl, associated with this circulating current.  "
The direction of this magnetic moment is into the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.23.  
" -LRB- This follows from the right-hand rule discussed earlier and the fact that the negatively charged electron is moving anti-clockwise, leading to a clockwise current -RRB- .  "
"Here, l is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron about the central nucleus  -LRB- ""orbital "" angular momentum -RRB- .  "
"In the Bohr model of hydrogen-like atoms, the negatively charged electron is revolving with uniform speed around a centrally placed positively charged  -LRB- +Ze -RRB-  nucleus.  "
The uniform circular motion of the electron constitutes a current.  
The direction of the magnetic moment is into the plane of the paper and is indicated separately by ⊗.  
The negative sign indicates that the angular momentum of the electron is opposite in direction to the magnetic moment.  
"Instead of electron with charge  -LRB- —e -RRB- , if we had taken a particle with charge  -LRB- +q -RRB- , the angular momentum and magnetic moment would be in the same direction.  "
"Its value is 8.8 × 1010 C/kg for an electron, which has been verified by experiments.  "
"The fact that even at an atomic level there is a magnetic moment, confirms Ampere's bold hypothesis of atomic magnetic moments.  "
"This according to Ampere, would help one to explain the magnetic properties of materials.  "
Can one assign a value to this atomic dipole moment?  
One can do so within the Bohr model.  
This condition of discreteness is called the Bohr quantisation condition.  
We shall discuss it in detail in Chapter 12.  
Our aim here is merely to use it to calculate the elementary dipole moment.  
This value is called the Bohr magneton.  
Any charge in uniform circular motion would have an associated magnetic moment given by an expression similar to Eq.  -LRB- 4.34 -RRB- .  
This dipole moment is labeled as the orbital magnetic moment.  
Hence the subscript 'l’ in µl.  
"Besides the orbital moment, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment, which has the same numerical value as given in Eq.  -LRB- 4.37 -RRB- .  "
It is called the spin magnetic moment.  
But we hasten to add that it is not as though the electron is spinning.  
The electron is an elementary particle and it does not have an axis to spin around like a top or our earth.  
Nevertheless it does possess this intrinsic magnetic moment.  
The microscopic roots of magnetism in iron and other materials can be traced back to this intrinsic spin magnetic moment.  
Currents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in Chapters 3.  
But how do we measure them?  
How do we claim that current in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?  
Figure 4.24 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the moving coil galvanometer  -LRB- MCG -RRB- .  
It is a device whose principle can be understood on the basis of our discussion in Section 4.10.  
"The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate about a fixed axis  -LRB- Fig. 4.24 -RRB- , in a uniform radial magnetic field.  "
There is a cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also increases the strength of the magnetic field.  
"When a current flows through the coil, a torque acts on it.  "
"Since the field is radial by design, we have taken sin θ=1 in the above expression for the torque.  "
The deflection φ is indicated on the scale by a pointer attached to the spring.  
The quantity in brackets is a constant for a given galvanometer.  
The galvanometer can be used in a number of ways.  
It can be used as a detector to check if a current is flowing in the circuit.  
We have come across this usage in the Wheatstone's bridge arrangement.  
"Depending on the direction of the current, the pointer deflection is either to the right or the left.  "
The galvanometer can not as such be used as an ammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit.  
"To overcome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance rs, called shunt resistance, in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the current passes through the shunt.  "
The scale of this ammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off the current value with ease.  
We define the current sensitivity of the ammeter as the deflection per unit current.  
A convenient way for the manufacturer to increase the sensitivity is to increase the number of turns N.  
"We choose galvanometers having sensitivities of value, required by our experiment.  "
The galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the voltage across a given section of the circuit.  
For this it must be connected in parallel with that section of the circuit.  
"Further, it must draw a very small current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original set up by an amount which is very large.  "
Usually we like to keep the disturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  
"To ensure this, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer.  "
This arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.26.  
﻿Magnetic phenomena are universal in nature.  
"Vast, distant galaxies, the tiny invisible atoms, men and beasts all are permeated through and through with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources.  "
The earth's magnetism predates human evolution.  
"The word magnet is derived from the name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore deposits were found, as early as 600 BC.  "
Shepherds on this island complained that their wooden shoes  -LRB- which had nails -RRB-  at times stayed struck to the ground.  
Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected.  
This attractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around.  
The directional property of magnets was also known since ancient times.  
"A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in the north-south direction.  "
A similar effect was observed when it was placed on a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water.  
The name lodestone  -LRB- or loadstone -RRB-  given to a naturally occurring ore of iron-magnetite means leading stone.  
The technological exploitation of this property is generally credited to the Chinese.  
Chinese texts dating 400 BC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships.  
Caravans crossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.  
"A Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti about four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen  -LRB- whom nowadays you would call engineers -RRB- .  "
These 'engineers built a chariot on which they placed a magnetic figure with arms outstretched.  
Figure 5.1 is an artist's description of this chariot.  
The figure swiveled around so that the finger of the statuette on it always pointed south.  
"With this chariot, Huang-ti's troops were able to attack the enemy from the rear in thick fog, and to defeat them.  "
In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric currents produce magnetic fields.  
"This discovery, which was made in the early part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot and Savart, among others.  "
"In the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its own right.  "
Some of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:  -LRB- i -RRB-  The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing approximately from the geographic south to the north.  
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in the north-south direction.  "
The tip which points to the geographic north is called the north pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called the south pole of the magnet.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  There is a repulsive force when north poles  -LRB- or south poles -RRB-  of two magnets are brought close together.  
"Conversely, there is an attractive force between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of the other.  "
" -LRB- iv -RRB-  We can not isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet.  "
"If a bar magnet is broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with somewhat weaker properties.  "
"Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic north and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist.  "
 -LRB- v -RRB-  It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.  
We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behavior in an external magnetic field.  
We describe Gauss's law of magnetism.  
We then follow it up with an account of the earth's magnetic field.  
One of the earliest childhood memories of the famous physicist Albert Einstein was that of a magnet gifted to him by a relative. 
"Einstein was fascinated, and played endlessly with it.  "
He wondered how the magnet could affect objects such as nails or pins placed away from it and not in any way connected to it by a spring or string.  
The arm of the statuette mounted on the chariot always points south.  
This is an artist's sketch of one of the earliest known compasses.  
The magnetic field lines are a visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field.  
Their properties are:  -LRB- i -RRB-  The magnetic field lines of a magnet  -LRB- or a solenoid -RRB-  form continuous closed loops.  
This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines begin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape to infinity.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  The tangent to the field line at a given point represents the direction of the net magnetic field B at that point.  
One can plot the magnetic field lines in a variety of ways.  
One way is to place a small magnetic compass needle at various positions and note its orientation.  
This gives us an idea of the magnetic field direction at various points in space.  
"In the previous chapter, we have explained how a current loop acts as a magnetic dipole  -LRB- Section 4.10 -RRB- .  "
We mentioned Ampere's hypothesis that all magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of circulating currents.   
"Recall that the magnetic dipole moment m associated with a current loop was defined to be m = NIA where N is the number of turns in the loop, I the current and A the area vector.  "
Cutting a bar magnet in half is like cutting a solenoid.  
We get two smaller solenoids with weaker magnetic properties.  
"The field lines remain continuous, emerging from one face of the solenoid and entering into the other face.  "
To make this analogy more firm we calculate the axial field of a finite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.4  -LRB- a -RRB- .  
We shall demonstrate that at large distances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.  
Let the solenoid of Fig. 5.4  -LRB- a -RRB-  consists of n turns per unit length.  
"We can evaluate the axial field at a point P, at a distance r from the center of the solenoid.  "
"To do this, consider a circular element of thickness dx of the solenoid at a distance x from its center.  "
It consists of ndx turns.  
Let I be the current in the solenoid.  
In Section 4.6 of the previous chapter we have calculated the magnetic field on the axis of a circular current loop.  
Calculation of the axial field of a finite solenoid in order to demonstrate its similarity to that of a bar magnet.  
 -LRB- b -RRB-  A magnetic needle in a uniform magnetic field B.  
The magnitude of the total field is obtained by summing over all the elements — in other words by integrating from x = —l to x = +l.  
"Thus, This integration can be done by trigonometric substitutions.  "
"This exercise, however, is not necessary for our purpose.  "
Note that the range of x is from —l to +l.  
"Consider the far axial field of the solenoid, i.e., r  _GREAT_GT;  _GREAT_GT;  a and r  _GREAT_GT;  _GREAT_GT;  l.  "
This is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may obtain experimentally.  
"Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar magnetic fields.  "
The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to the magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same magnetic field.  
The method is simple and appealing.  
"However, magnetic monopoles do not exist, and we have avoided this approach for that reason.  "
"The pattern of iron filings, i.e., the magnetic field lines gives us an appr oximate idea of the magnetic field B.  "
We may at times be required to determine the magnitude of B accurately.  
This is done by placing a small compass needle of known magnetic moment m and moment of inertia I and allowing it to oscillate in the magnetic field.  
This arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.4 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
Here τ is restoring torque and θ is the angle between m and B.  
Negative sign with mB sinθ implies that restoring torque is in opposition to deflecting torque.  
"For small values of θ in radians, we approximate sin θ ≈ θ.  "
This represents a simple harmonic motion.  
An expression for magnetic potential energy can also be obtained on lines similar to electrostatic potential energy.  
We have emphasised that the zero of potential energy can be fixed at one’s convenience.  
"Taking the constant of integration to be zero means fixing the zero of potential energy at θ = 90º, i.e., when the needle is perpendicular to the field.  "
Table 5.1 summarises the analogy between electric and magnetic dipoles.  
"In Chapter 1, we studied Gauss's law for electrostatics.  "
"In Fig 5.3 -LRB- c -RRB- , we see that for a closed surface represented by i, the number of lines leaving the surface is equal to the number of lines entering it.  "
This is consistent with the fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface.  
"However, in the same figure, for the closed surface ii, there is a net outward flux, since it does include a net  -LRB- positive -RRB-  charge.  "
The situation is radically different for magnetic fields which are continuous and form closed loops.  
Examine the Gaussian surfaces represented by i or ii in Fig 5.3 -LRB- a -RRB-  or Fig. 5.3 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
Both cases visually demonstrate that the number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is balanced by the number of lines entering it.  
The net magnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces ; This is true for any closed surface.  
Consider a small vector area element ∆S of a closed surface S as in Fig. 5.6.  
We divide S into many small area elements and calculate the individual flux through each.  
The difference between the Gauss’s law of magnetism and that for electrostatics is a reflection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles  -LRB- also called monopoles -RRB-  are not known to exist.  
There are no sources or sinks of B ; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop.  
All magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of dipoles and/or current loops.  
The net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero.  
Earlier we have referred to the magnetic field of the earth.  
The strength of the earth’s magnetic field varies from place to place on the earth’s surface; its value being of the order of 10–5 T.  
What causes the earth to have a magnetic field is not clear.  
Originally the magnetic field was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet placed approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in the interior.  
"However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct.  "
The magnetic field is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced by convective motion of metallic fluids  -LRB- consisting mostly of molten iron and nickel -RRB-  in the outer core of the earth.  
This is known as the dynamo effect.  
The magnetic field lines of the earth resemble that of a  -LRB- hypothetical -RRB-  magnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth.  
The axis of the dipole does not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently titled by approximately 11.3º with respect to the later.  
"In this way of looking at it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic field lines due to the dipole enter or leave the earth.  "
"The location of the north magnetic pole is at a latitude of  79.74º N and a longitude of 71.8º W, a place somewhere in north Canada.  "
"The magnetic south pole is at 79.74º S, 108.22º E in the Antarctica.  "
The pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the north magnetic pole.  
"Likewise, the pole near the geographic south pole is called the south magnetic pole.  "
There is some confusion in the nomenclature of the poles.  
The convention arose because the magnetic north was the direction to which the north pole of a magnetic needle pointed; the north pole of a magnet was so named as it was the north seeking pole.  
"Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole behaves like the south pole of a bar magnet inside the earth and vice versa.  "
Magnetic declination and dip Consider a point on the earth's surface.  
"At such a point, the direction of the longitude circle determines the geographic north-south direction, the line of longitude towards the north pole being the direction of true north.  "
The vertical plane containing the longitude circle and the axis of rotation of the earth is called the geographic meridian.  
"In a similar way, one can define magnetic meridian of a place as the vertical plane which passes through the imaginary line joining the magnetic north and the south poles.  "
This plane would intersect the surface of the earth in a longitude like circle.  
"A magnetic needle, which is free to swing horizontally, would then lie in the magnetic meridian and the north pole of the needle would point towards the magnetic north pole.  "
"Since the line joining the magnetic poles is titled with respect to the geographic axis of the earth, the magnetic meridian at a point makes angle with the geographic meridian.  "
"This, then, is the angle between the true geographic north and the north shown by a compass needle.  "
This angle is called the magnetic declination or simply declination  -LRB- Fig. 5.9 -RRB- .  
"The declination is greater at higher latitudes and smaller near the equator ; The declination in India is small, it being 0º41 ′ E at Delhi and 0º58 ′ W at Mumbai.   "
The earth as a giant magnetic dipole.  
"A magnetic needle free to move in horizontal plane, points toward the magnetic north-south direction.  "
"Thus, at both these places a magnetic needle shows the true north quite accurately.  "
There is one more quantity of interest.  
"If a magnetic needle is perfectly balanced about a horizontal axis so that it can swing in a plane of the magnetic meridian, the needle would make an angle with the horizontal.  "
This is known as the angle of dip  -LRB- also known as inclination -RRB- .  
"Thus, dip is the angle that the total magnetic field BE of the earth makes with the surface of the earth.  "
Figure 5.11 shows the magnetic meridian plane at a point P on the surface of the earth.  
The plane is a section through the earth.  
The total magnetic field at P can be resolved into a horizontal component HE and a vertical component ZE.  
"The angle that BE makes with HE is the angle of dip, I.  "
"In most of the northern hemisphere, the north pole of the dip needle tilts downwards.  "
"Likewise in most of the southern hemisphere, the south pole of the dip needle tilts downwards.  "
These are known as the element of the earth's magnetic field.  
The angle between BE and the horizontal component HE is the angle of dip.  
"Also shown are the declination, D and the inclination or angle of dip, I.  "
A compass needle consists of a magnetic needle which floats on a pivotal point.  
"When the compass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field at the location ; Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic meridian of the place.  "
In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals which cause the compass needle to deviate from the magnetic meridian.  
Knowing the magnetic declination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true north.  
So what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole?  
"At the poles, the magnetic field lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible.  "
"If the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction, rendering it useless as a direction finder.  "
What one needs in such a case is a dip needle which is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic field of the earth.  
The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic field makes with the vertical.  
At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down.  
The earth abounds with a bewildering variety of elements and compounds.  
"In addition, we have been synthesising new alloys, compounds and even elements.  "
One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these substances.  
"In the present section, we define and explain certain terms which will help us to carry out this exercise.  "
We have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic moment.  
"In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they can give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero.  "
We define magnetisation M of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per unit volume.  
M is a vector with dimensions L—1 A and is measured in a units of A m—1.  
Consider a long solenoid of n turns per unit length and carrying a current I.  
It must not be assumed that there is a giant bar magnet deep inside the earth which is causing the earth's magnetic field.  
"Although there are large deposits of iron inside the earth, it is highly unlikely that a large solid block of iron stretches from the magnetic north pole to the magnetic south pole.  "
"The earth's core is very hot and molten, and the ions of iron and nickel are responsible for earth's magnetism.  "
This hypothesis seems very probable.  
"However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and the energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood.  "
These are several open questions which form an important area of continuing research.  
The variation of the earth's magnetic field with position is also an interesting area of study.  
"Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and beyond, in a stream called the solar wind.  "
"Their motion is affected by the earth's magnetic field, and in turn, they affect the pattern of the earth's magnetic field.  "
The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is quite different from that in other regions of the earth.  
The variation of earth's magnetic field with time is no less fascinating.  
There are short term variations taking place over centuries and long term variations taking place over a period of a million years.  
"On the scale of a million years, the earth's magnetic fields has been found to reverse its direction.  "
"Basalt contains iron, and basalt is emitted during volcanic activity.  "
The little iron magnets inside it align themselves parallel to the magnetic field at that place as the basalt cools and solidifies.  
"Geological studies of basalt containing such pieces of magnetised region have provided evidence for the change of direction of earth’s magnetic field, several times in the past.  "
"If the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero magnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than B0.  "
"We have partitioned the contribution to the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due to external factors such as the current in the solenoid.  "
"The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material, namely M.  "
The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors.  
It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an external field.  
"It is small and positive for materials, which are called paramagnetic.  "
"It is small and negative for materials, which are termed diamagnetic.  "
In the latter case M and H are opposite in direction.  
It is the analog of the dielectric constant in electrostatics.  
The magnetic permeability of the substance is µ and it has the same dimensions and units as µ0.  
"When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from high to low field.  "
The simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows.  
Electrons in an atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum.  
These orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus possess orbital magnetic moment.  
Diamagnetic substances are the ones in which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero.  
This happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz's law which you will study in Chapter 6.  
"Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic moment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence repulsion.  "
"Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon, nitrogen  -LRB- at STP -RRB- , water and sodium chloride.  "
Diamagnetism is present in all the substances.  
"However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it gets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc..  "
The most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors.  
"These are metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect conductivity and perfect diamagnetism.  "
Here the field lines are completely expelled!  
A superconductor repels a magnet and  -LRB- by Newton's third law -RRB-  is repelled by the magnet.  
"The phenomenon of perfect diamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect, after the name of its discoverer.  "
"Superconducting magnets can be gainfully exploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically levitated superfast trains.  "
Paramagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field.  
"They have tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly attracted to a magnet.  "
The individual atoms  -LRB- or ions or molecules -RRB-  of a paramagnetic material possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own.  
"On account of the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation is seen.  "
"In the presence of an external field B0, which is strong enough, and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be made to align and point in the same direction as B0.  "
Figure 5.12 -LRB- b -RRB-  shows a bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field.  
"The field lines gets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced.  "
"In most cases, as is evident from Table 5.2, this enhancement is slight, being one part in 105.  "
"When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from weak field to strong.  "
"Some paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium, oxygen  -LRB- at STP -RRB-  and copper chloride.  "
"This is known as Curie's law, after its discoverer Pieree Curie  -LRB- 1859-1906 -RRB- .  "
The constant C is called Curie's constant.  
"Thus, for a paramagnetic material both χ and µr depend not only on the material, but also  -LRB- in a simple fashion -RRB-  on the sample temperature.  "
"As the field is increased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value, at which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field.  "
"Beyond this, Curie's law  -LRB- Eq.  -LRB- 5.20 -RRB-  -RRB-  is no longer valid.  "
Ferromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field.  
"They have strong tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get strongly attracted to a magnet.  "
The individual atoms  -LRB- or ions or molecules -RRB-  in a ferromagnetic material possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material.  
"However, they interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called domain.  "
The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook.  
Each domain has a net magnetisation.  
Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains about 1011 atoms.  
"In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly from domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation.  "
This is shown in Fig. 5.13 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"When we apply an external magnetic field B0, the domains orient themselves in the direction of B0 and simultaneously the domain oriented in the direction of B0 grow in size.  "
This existence of domains and their motion in B 0 are not speculations.  
One may observe this under a microscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered ferromagnetic substance of samples ; This motion of suspension can be observed.  
Figure 5.12 -LRB- b -RRB-  shows the situation when the domains have aligned and amalgamated to form a single 'giant' domain.  
"Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly concentrated.  "
"In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move towards the region of high field.  "
We may wonder as to what happens when the external field is removed.  
In some ferromagnetic materials the magnetisation persists.  
Such materials are called hard magnetic materials or hard ferromagnets.  
"Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt and copper, is one such material ; The naturally occurring lodestone is another.  "
Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other things as a compass needle.  
"On the other hand, there is a class of ferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal of the external field.  "
Soft iron is one such material.  
"Appropriately enough, such materials are called soft ferromagnetic materials.  "
"There are a number of elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, etc..  "
The relative magnetic permeability is  _GREAT_GT;  1000!  
The ferromagnetic property depends on temperature.  
"At high enough temperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet.  "
The domain structure disintegrates with temperature.  
This disappearance of magnetisation with temperature is gradual.  
It is a phase transition reminding us of the melting of a solid crystal.  
The temperature of transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetism is called the Curie temperature Tc.  
Table 5.4 lists the Curie temperature of certain ferromagnets.  
The relation between B and H in ferromagnetic materials is complex.  
It is often not linear and it depends on the magnetic history of the sample.  
Figure 5.14 depicts the behavior of the material as we take it through one cycle of magnetisation.  
Let the material be unmagnetised initially.  
We place it in a solenoid and increase the current through the solenoid.  
The magnetic field B in the material rises and saturates as depicted in the curve Oa.  
This behavior represents the alignment and merger of domains until no further enhancement is possible.  
It is pointless to increase the current  -LRB- and hence the magnetic intensity H -RRB-  beyond this.  
"Next, we decrease H and reduce it to zero.  "
This is represented by the curve ab.  
The value of B at H = 0 is called retentivity or remanence.  
"In Fig. 5.14, BR ~ 1.2 T, where the subscript R denotes retentivity.  "
The domains are not completely randomised even though the external driving field has been removed.  
"Next, the current in the solenoid is reversed and slowly increased.  "
Certain domains are flipped until the net field inside stands nullified.  
This is represented by the curve bc.  
The value of H at c is called coercivity.  
"As the reversed current is increased in magnitude, we once again obtain saturation.  "
The curve cd depicts this.  
The saturated magnetic field Bs ~ 1.5 T.  
"Next, the current is reduced  -LRB- curve de -RRB-  and reversed  -LRB- curve ea -RRB- .  "
The cycle repeats itself.  
"For a given value of H, B is not unique but depends on previous history of the sample.  "
This phenomenon is called hysterisis.  
The word hysterisis means lagging behind  -LRB- and not 'history' -RRB- .  
"Further, the material should have a high permeability.  "
Steel is one-favoured choice.  
It has a slightly smaller retentivity than soft iron but this is outweighed by the much smaller coercivity of soft iron.  
"Other suitable materials for permanent magnets are alnico, cobalt steel and ticonal.  "
Core of electromagnets are made of ferromagnetic materials which have high permeability and low retentivity.  
Soft iron is a suitable material for electromagnets.  
"On placing a soft iron rod in a solenoid and passing a current, we increase the magnetism of the solenoid by a thousand fold.  "
"When we switch off the solenoid current, the magnetism is effectively switched off since the soft iron core has a low retentivity.  "
The arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.16.  
"In certain applications, the material goes through an ac cycle of magnetisation for a long period.  "
This is the case in transformer cores and telephone diaphragms.  
The hysteresis curve of such materials must be narrow.  
The energy dissipated and the heating will consequently be small.  
The material must have a high resistivity to lower eddy current losses.  
You will study about eddy currents in Chapter 6.  
"Electromagnets are used in electric bells, loudspeakers and telephone diaphragms.  "
"Giant electromagnets are used in cranes to lift machinery, and bulk quantities of iron and steel.  "
"Because of its practical application in prospecting, communication, and navigation, the magnetic field of the earth is mapped by most nations with an accuracy comparable to geographical mapping.  "
"In India over a dozen observatories exist, extending from Trivandrum  -LRB- now Thrivuvananthapuram -RRB-  in the south to Gulmarg in the north.  "
"These observatories work under the aegis of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism  -LRB- IIG -RRB- , in Colaba, Mumbai.  "
The IIG grew out of the Colaba and Alibag observatories and was formally established in 1971.  
"The IIG monitors  -LRB- via its nation-wide observatories -RRB- , the geomagnetic fields and fluctuations on land, and under the ocean and in space.  "
"Its services are used by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.  -LRB- ONGC -RRB- , the National Institute of Oceanography  -LRB- NIO -RRB-  and the Indian Space Research Organisation  -LRB- ISRO -RRB- .  "
It is a part of the world-wide network which ceaselessly updates the geomagnetic data.  
Now India has a permanent station called Gangotri.  
Electricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated phenomena for a long time.  
"In the early decades of the nineteenth century, experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others established the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related.  "
They found that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields.  
"For example, an electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.  "
This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?  
Can moving magnets produce electric currents?  
Does the nature permit such a relation between electricity and magnetism?  
The answer is resounding yes!  
"The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and Joseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated conclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when subjected to changing magnetic fields.  "
"In this chapter, we will study the phenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand the underlying principles.  "
The phenomenon in which electric current is generated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called electromagnetic induction.  
"His reply was: ""What is the use of a new born baby? ""  "
The pioneering experiments of Faraday and Henry have led directly to the development of modern day generators and transformers.  
Today's civilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the discovery of electromagnetic induction.  
The discovery and understanding of electromagnetic induction are based on a long series of experiments carried out by Faraday and Henry.  
We shall now describe some of these experiments.  
The deflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion.  
The galvanometer does not show any deflection when the magnet is held stationary.  
"When the magnet is pulled away from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in the opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the current's direction.  "
"Moreover, when the South-pole of the bar magnet is moved towards or away from the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite to that observed with the North-pole for similar movements.  "
"Further, the deflection  -LRB- and hence current -RRB-  is found to be larger when the magnet is pushed towards or pulled away from the coil faster.  "
"Instead, when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C1 is moved towards or away from the magnet, the same effects are observed.  "
It shows that it is the relative motion between the magnet and the coil that is responsible for generation  -LRB- induction -RRB-  of electric current in the coil.  
In Fig. 6.2 the bar magnet is replaced by a second coil C2 connected to a battery.  
The steady current in the coil C2 produces a steady magnetic field.  
"As coil C2 is moved towards the coil C1, the galvanometer shows a deflection.  "
This indicates that electric current is induced in coil C1.  
"When C2 is moved away, the galvanometer shows a deflection again, but this time in the opposite direction.  "
The deflection lasts as long as coil C2 is in motion.  
"When the coil C2 is held fixed and C1 is moved, the same effects are observed.  "
"Again, it is the relative motion between the coils that induces the electric current.  "
"The above two experiments involved relative motion between a magnet and a coil and between two coils, respectively.  "
"Through another experiment, Faraday showed that this relative motion is not an absolute requirement.  "
Figure 6.3 shows two coils C1 and C2 held stationary.  
Coil C1 is connected to galvanometer G while the second coil C2 is connected to a battery through a tapping key K.  
It is observed that the galvanometer shows a momentary deflection when the tapping key K is pressed ; The pointer in the galvanometer returns to zero immediately.  
"If the key is held pressed continuously, there is no deflection in the galvanometer.  "
"When the key is released, a momentory deflection is observed again, but in the opposite direction.  "
It is also observed that the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted into the coils along their axis.  
Faraday's great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation to explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic induction.  
"However, before we state and appreciate his laws, we must get familiar with the notion of magnetic flux, ΦB.  "
Magnetic flux is defined in the same way as electric flux is defined in Chapter 1.  
The notion of the area as a vector has been discussed earlier in Chapter 1.  
Equation  -LRB- 6.1 -RRB-  can be extended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.  
The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber  -LRB- Wb -RRB-  or tesla meter squared -LRB- T m2 -RRB- .  
Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.  
"From the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a conclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic flux through the coil changes with time.  "
Experimental observations discussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.  
The change in magnetic flux induces emf in coil C1.  
It was this induced emf which caused electric current to flow in coil C1 and through the galvanometer.  
"Consequently, the magnetic flux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases.  "
It is the change in magnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.  
"When the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant.  "
The induced emf can be increased by increasing the number of turns N of a closed coil.  
"From Eqs.  -LRB- 6.1 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 6.2 -RRB- , we see that the flux can be varied by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and θ.  "
"In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux is changed by varying B.  "
"In these cases too, an emf is induced in the respective coils.  "
The negative sign shown in Eq. -LRB- 6.3 -RRB-  represents this effect.  
We can understand Lenz's law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1.  
"In Fig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed towards the closed coil.  "
"As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases.  "
Hence current is induced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.  
This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.  
Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity towards the North-pole of the approaching magnet.  
"Similarly, if the North-pole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil will decrease.  "
"To counter this decrease in magnetic flux, the induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-pole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet.  "
This would result in an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the corresponding decrease in flux.  
What will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop in the above example?  
"In this case too, an emf is induced across the open ends of the circuit.  "
The direction of the induced emf can be found using Lenz's law.  
Consider Figs. 6.6 -LRB- a -RRB-  and  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
They provide an easier way to understand the direction of induced currents.  
Note that the direction shown by and indicate the directions of the induced currents.  
A little reflection on this matter should convince us on the correctness of Lenz's law.  
Suppose that the induced current was in the direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"In that case, the South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching North-pole of the magnet.  "
The bar magnet will then be attracted towards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration.  
A gentle push on the magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy will continuously increase without expending any energy.  
"If this can happen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a suitable arrangement.  "
This violates the law of conservation of energy and hence can not happen.  
Now consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"In this situation, the bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced current.  "
"Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.  "
Where does the energy spent by the person go?  
This energy is dissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.  
Let us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-independent magnetic field.  
Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor PQRS in which the conductor PQ is free to move.  
The rod PQ is moved towards the left with a constant velocity v as shown in the figure.  
Assume that there is no loss of energy due to friction.  
PQRS forms a closed circuit enclosing an area that changes as PQ moves.  
It is placed in a uniform magnetic field B which is perpendicular to the plane of this system.  
"Since x is changing with time, the rate of change of flux ΦB will induce an emf.  "
"The arm PQ is moved to the left side, thus decreasing the area of the rectangular loop.  "
This movement induces a current I as shown.  
The induced emf Blv is called motional emf.  
"Thus, we are able to produce induced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field, that is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.  "
It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq.  -LRB- 6.5 -RRB-  by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor PQ.  
Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ.  
"When the rod moves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed v in the magnetic field B.  "
"The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude, and its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in magnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.  "
We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous.  
But it does help us to understand the basis of Faraday's law when the conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent magnetic field.  
"In the case of a stationary conductor, the force on its charges is given by F = q -LRB- E+v×B -RRB-  = qE, since v=0.  "
"Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric field term E alone.  "
"Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or induced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field generates an electric field.  "
"However, we hasten to add that electric fields produced by static electric charges have properties different from those produced by time-varying magnetic fields.  "
"In Chapter 4, we learned that charges in motion  -LRB- current -RRB-  can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet.  "
"Conversely, a bar magnet in motion  -LRB- or more generally, a changing magnetic field -RRB-  can exert a force on the stationary charge.  "
This is the fundamental significance of the Faraday's discovery.  
Electricity and magnetism are related.  
"In Section 6.5, we discussed qualitatively that Lenz's law is consistent with the law of conservation of energy.  "
Now we shall explore this aspect further with a concrete example.  
Let r be the resistance of movable arm PQ of the rectangular conductor shown in Fig. 6.10.  
"We assume that the remaining arms QR, RS and SP have negligible resistances compared to r.  "
"Thus, the overall resistance of the rectangular loop is r and this does not change as PQ is moved.  "
"On account of the presence of the magnetic field, there will be a force on the arm PQ.  "
"This force I -LRB- l×B -RRB- , is directed outwards in the direction opposite to the velocity of the rod.  "
"The magnitude of this force is, F = IlB.  "
Note that this force arises due to drift velocity of charges  -LRB- responsible for current -RRB-  along the rod and the consequent Lorentz force acting on them.  
The agent that does this work is mechanical.  
Where does this mechanical energy go?  
"Thus, mechanical energy which was needed to move the arm PQ is converted into electrical energy  -LRB- the induced emf -RRB-  and then to thermal energy.  "
There is an interesting relationship between the charge flow through the circuit and the change in the magnetic flux.  
So far we have studied the electric currents induced in well defined paths in conductors like circular loops.  
"Even when bulk pieces of conductors are subjected to changing magnetic flux, induced currents are produced in them.  "
"However, their flow patterns resemble swirling eddies in water.  "
This effect was discovered by physicist Foucault  -LRB- 1819-1868 -RRB-  and these currents are called eddy currents.  
Consider the apparatus shown in Fig. 6.13.  
We can explain this phenomenon on the basis of electromagnetic induction.  
Note that magnetic moments of the induced currents  -LRB- which oppose the motion -RRB-  depend upon the area enclosed by the currents  -LRB- recall equation m = IA in Chapter 4 -RRB- .  
"This fact is helpful in reducing eddy currents in the metallic cores of transformers, electric motors and other such devices in which a coil is to be wound over metallic core.  "
Eddy currents are undesirable since they heat up the core and dissipate electrical energy in the form of heat.  
Eddy currents are minimized by using laminations of metal to make a metal core.  
The laminations are separated by an insulating material like lacquer.  
"The plane of the laminations must be arranged parallel to the magnetic field, so that they cut across the eddy current paths.  "
This arrangement reduces the strength of the eddy currents.  
"Since the dissipation of electrical energy into heat depends on the square of the strength of electric current, heat loss is substantially reduced.  "
Eddy currents are used to advantage in certain applications like:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Magnetic braking in trains: Strong electromagnets are situated above the rails in some electrically powered trains.  
"When the electromagnets are activated, the eddy currents induced in the rails oppose the motion of the train.  "
"As there are no mechanical linkages, the braking effect is smooth.  "
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Electromagnetic damping: Certain galvanometers have a fixed core made of nonmagnetic metallic material.  
"When the coil oscillates, the eddy currents generated in the core oppose the motion and bring the coil to rest quickly.  "
A high frequency alternating current is passed through a coil which surrounds the metals to be melted.  
The eddy currents generated in the metals produce high temperatures sufficient to melt it.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Electric power meters: The shiny metal disc in the electric power meter  -LRB- analog type -RRB-  rotates due to the eddy currents.  
Electric currents are induced in the disc by magnetic fields produced by sinusoidally varying currents in a coil.  
You can observe the rotating shiny disc in the power meter of your house.  
"Take two hollow thin cylindrical pipes of equal internal diameters made of aluminium and PVC, respectively.  "
Fix them vertically with clamps on retort stands.  
You will observe that the magnet dropped through the PVC pipe takes the same time to come out of the pipe as it would take when dropped through the same height without the pipe.  
Note the time it takes to come out of the pipe in each case.  
You will see that the magnet takes much longer time in the case of aluminium pipe.  
Why is it so?  
"It is due to the eddy currents that are generated in the aluminium pipe which oppose the change in magnetic flux, i.e., the motion of the magnet.  "
The retarding force due to the eddy currents inhibits the motion of the magnet.  
Such phenomena are referred to as electromagnetic damping.  
Note that eddy currents are not generated in PVC pipe as its material is an insulator whereas aluminium is a conductor.  
An electric current can be induced in a coil by flux change produced by another coil in its vicinity or flux change produced by the same coil.  
These two situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections.  
"However, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to the current.  "
"That is, ΦB α I.  "
"For a closely wound coil of N turns, the same magnetic flux is linked with all the turns.  "
"When the flux ΦB through the coil changes, each turn contributes to the induced emf.  "
"Therefore, a term called flux linkage is used which is equal to NΦB for a closely wound coil and in such a case NΦB ∝ I.  "
"The constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance.  "
We shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coil and intrinsic material properties.  
Inductance is a scalar quantity.  
It has the dimensions of  -LRB- ML2T—2A—2 -RRB-  given by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current.  
The SI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H.  
"It is named in honor of Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA, independently of Faraday in England.  "
Consider Fig. 6.15 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length l.  
We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S1 by r1 and the number of turns per unit length by n1.  
"The corresponding quantities for the outer solenoid S2 are r2 and n2, respectively.  "
"Let N1 and N2 be the total number of turns of coils S1 and S2, respectively.  "
"When a current I2 is set up through S2, it in turn sets up a magnetic flux through S1.  "
Let us denote it by Φ1.  
"In that experiment, emf is induced in coil C1 wherever there was any change in current through coil C2.  "
Let Φ1 be the flux through coil C1  -LRB- say of N1 turns -RRB-  when current in coil C2 is I2.  
The self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the permeability of the medium.  
The self-induced emf is also called the back emf as it opposes any change in the current in a circuit.  
"Physically, the self-inductance plays the role of inertia.  "
It is the electromagnetic analog of mass in mechanics.  
"So, work needs to be done against the back emf  -LRB- ε -RRB-  in establishing the current.  "
This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy.  
Consider the general case of currents flowing simultaneously in two nearby coils.  
The flux linked with one coil will be the sum of two fluxes which exist independently.  
"Therefore, using Faraday's law, M11 is the self-inductance and is written as L1.  "
The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction has been technologically exploited in many ways.  
An exceptionally important application is the generation of alternating currents  -LRB- ac -RRB- .  
The modern ac generator with a typical output capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine.  
"In this section, we shall describe the basic principles behind this machine.  "
The Yugoslav inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the development of the machine.  
"As was pointed out in Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf or current in a loop is through a change in the loop's orientation or a change in its effective area.  "
"As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the effective area of the loop  -LRB- the face perpendicular to the field -RRB-  is A cos θ, where θ is the angle between A and B.  "
This method of producing a flux change is the principle of operation of a simple ac generator.  
"If we denote NBAω as ε0, then ε = ε0 sin ωt.  "
"Since the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and —1, the sign, or polarity of the emf changes with time.  "
"Note from Fig. 6.17 that the emf has its extremum value when θ = 90º or θ = 270º, as the change of flux is greatest at these points.  "
The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current is called alternating current  -LRB- ac -RRB- .  
Note that Eq.  -LRB- 6.22 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 6.23 -RRB-  give the instantaneous value of the emf and ε varies between +ε0 and —ε0 periodically.  
We shall learn how to determine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current in the next chapter.  
"In commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for rotation of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for example, from dams.  "
These are called hydro-electric generators.  
"Alternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or other sources.  "
The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of the armature.  
These are called thermal generators.  
"Instead of coal, if a nuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators.  "
"Modern day generators produce electric power as high as 500 MW, i.e., one can light up 5 million 100 W bulbs!  "
"In most generators, the coils are held stationary and it is the electromagnets which are rotated.  "
The frequency of rotation is 50 Hz in India.  
"In certain countries such as USA, it is 60 Hz.  "
An alternating emf is generated by a loop of wire rotating in a magnetic field.  
"The migratory pattern of birds is one of the mysteries in the field of biology, and indeed all of science.  "
"For example, every winter birds from Siberia fly unerringly to water spots in the Indian subcontinent.  "
There has been a suggestion that electromagnetic induction may provide a clue to these migratory patterns.  
The earth's magnetic field has existed throughout evolutionary history.  
It would be of great benefit to migratory birds to use this field to determine the direction.  
As far as we know birds contain no ferromagnetic material.  
So electromagnetic induction seems to be the only reasonable mechanism to determine direction.  
This extremely small potential difference suggests that our hypothesis is of doubtful validity.  
Certain kinds of fish are able to detect small potential differences.  
"However, in these fish, special cells have been identified which detect small voltage differences.  "
In birds no such cells have been identified.  
"Thus, the migration patterns of birds continues to remain a mystery.  "
﻿We have so far considered direct current  -LRB- dc -RRB-  sources and circuits with dc sources.  
These currents do not change direction with time.  
But voltages and currents that vary with time are very common.  
Figure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source ε of ac voltage.  
The symbol for an ac source in a circuit diagram is ~.  
We consider a source which produces sinusoidally varying potential  difference across its terminals.  
"Let this potential difference, also called ac voltage, be given by ω = vm sin ωt, where vm is the amplitude of the oscillating potential difference and ω is its angular frequency.  "
"Note, in particular that both v and i reach zero, minimum and maximum values at the same time.  "
"Clearly, the voltage and current are in phase with each other.  "
"We see that, like the applied voltage, the current varies sinusoidally and has corresponding positive and negative values during each cycle.  "
"Thus, the sum of the instantaneous current values over one complete cycle is zero, and the average current is zero.  "
"The fact that the average current is zero, however, does not mean that the average power consumed is zero and that there is no dissipation of electrical energy.  "
"FIGURE 7.2 In a pure resistor, the voltage and current are in phase.  "
"The minima, zero and maxima occur at the same respective times.  "
"As you know, Joule heating is given by i2R and depends on i2  -LRB- which is always positive whether i is positive or negative -RRB-  and not on i.  "
"Thus, there is Joule heating and dissipation of electrical energy when an ac current passes through a resistor.  "
This shows the advantage of introducing the concept of rms values.  
"In terms of rms values, the equation for power  -LRB- Eq. -LRB- 7.7 -RRB-  -RRB-  and relation between current and voltage in ac circuits are essentially the same as those for the dc case.  "
It is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities.  
"For example, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peak voltage of vm = 2V =  -LRB- 1.414 -RRB-  -LRB- 220 V -RRB-  = 311 V.  "
"In fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that would produce the same average power loss as the alternating current.  "
Equation -LRB- 7.7 -RRB-  can also be written as P = V2 / R = I V  -LRB- since V = I R -RRB- .  
"In the previous section, we learned that the current through a resistor is in phase with the ac voltage.  "
"But this is not so in the case of an inductor, a capacitor or a combination of these circuit elements.  "
"In order to show phase relationship between voltage and current in an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.  "
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor diagram.  
"A phasor is a vector which rotates about the origin with angular speed ω, as shown in Fig. 7.4.  "
The vertical components of phasors V and I represent the sinusoidally varying quantities v and i.  
The magnitudes of phasors V and I represent the amplitudes or the peak values vm and im of these oscillating quantities.  
"Figure 7.4  -LRB- a -RRB-  shows the voltage and current phasors and their relationship at time t1 for the case of an ac source connected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1.  "
"The projection of voltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., vmsin ωt and imsin ωt, respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant.  "
"As they rotate with frequency ω, curves in Fig. 7.4  -LRB- b -RRB-  are generated.  "
From Fig. 7.4  -LRB- a -RRB-  we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are in the same direction.  
This is so for all times.  
This means that the phase angle between the voltage and the current is zero.  
Figure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor.  
"Usually, inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall assume that this inductor has negligible resistance.  "
"Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit.  "
FIGURE 7.5 An ac source connected to an inductor.  
"Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors—rotating vectors, they are not vectors themselves.  "
They are scalar quantities.  
It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding magnitudes and directions.  
The rotating vectors that represent harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know.  
"To obtain the current, we integrate di/dt with respect to time.  "
The integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-independent.  
"Therefore, the integration constant is zero.  "
"The quantity ωL is analogous to the resistance and is called inductive reactance, denoted by XL.  "
The dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance and its SI unit is ohm  -LRB- Ω -RRB- .  
The inductive reactance limits the current in a purely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the current in a purely resistive circuit.  
The inductive reactance is directly proportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.  
A comparison of Eqs.  -LRB- 7.1 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 7.12 -RRB-  for the source voltage and the current in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by π/2 or one-quarter  -LRB- 1/4 -RRB-  cycle.  
Figure 7.6  -LRB- a -RRB-  shows the voltage and the current phasors in the present case at instant t1.  
The current phasor I is π/2 behind the voltage phasor V.  
You have seen that an inductor has reactance that limits current similar to resistance in a dc circuit.  
Does it also consume power like a resistance?  
Let us try to find out.  
"So, the average power over a complete cycle is = 0, since the average of sin  -LRB- 2ωt -RRB-  over a complete cycle is zero.  "
"Thus, the average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle is zero.  "
Figure 7.7 explains it in detail.  
Current i through the coil entering at A increase from zero to a maximum value.  
"Flux lines are set up i.e., the core gets magnetised.  "
With the polarity shown voltage and current are both positive ; So their product p is positive.  
Energy is absorbed from the source.  
Current in the coil is still positive but is decreasing.  
The core gets demagnetised and the net flux becomes zero at the end of a half cycle.  
The voltage v is negative  -LRB- since di/dt is negative -RRB- .  
" The product of voltage and current is negative, and energy is being returned to source.  "
One complete cycle of voltage/current.  
Note that the current lags the voltage.  
"Current i becomes negative i.e., it enters at B and comes out of A.  "
"Since the direction of current has changed, the polarity of the magnet changes.  "
The current and voltage are both negative ; So their product p is positive.  
Energy is absorbed.  
Current i decreases and reaches its zero value at 4 when core is demagnetised and flux is zero.  
The voltage is positive but the current is negative.  
"The power is, therefore, negative.  "
Energy absorbed during the 1/4 cycle is returned to the source.  
"Figure 7.8 shows an ac source ε generating ac voltage v = vmsin ωt connected to a capacitor only, a purely capacitive ac circuit.  "
"That is, a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the current as it charges.  "
"When the capacitor is fully charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.  "
"When the capacitor is connected to an ac source, as in Fig. 7.8, it limits or regulates the current, but does not completely prevent the flow of charge.  "
The capacitor is alternately charged and discharged as the current reverses each half cycle.  
Let q be the charge on the capacitor at any time t.  
"From the Kirchhoff's loop rule, the voltage across the source and the capacitor are equal.  "
"Comparing it to im = vm/R for a purely resistive circuit, we find that  -LRB- 1/ωC -RRB-  plays the role of resistance.  "
It is called capacitive reactance and is denoted by Xc.  
An ac source connected to a capacitor.  
The dimension of capacitive reactance is the same as that of resistance and its SI unit is ohm  -LRB- Ω -RRB- .  
"A comparison of Eq.  -LRB- 7.16 -RRB-  with the equation of source voltage, Eq.  -LRB- 7.1 -RRB-  shows that the current is π/2 ahead of voltage.  "
Figure 7.9 -LRB- a -RRB-  shows the phasor diagram at an instant t1.  
Here the current phasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotate counterclockwise.  
Figure 7.9  -LRB- b -RRB-  shows the variation of voltage and current with time.  
We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than the voltage by one-fourth of a period.  
The instantaneous power supplied to the capacitor is pc = iv = im cos -LRB- ωt -RRB- vm sin -LRB- ωt -RRB-  = imvm cos -LRB- ωt -RRB- sin -LRB- ω t -RRB- .  
"Thus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltage by π/2 and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2.  "
"The current i flows as shown and from the maximum at 0, reaches a zero value at 1.  "
The plate A is charged to positive polarity while negative charge q builds up in B reaching a maximum at 1 until the current becomes zero.  
The voltage vc = q/C is in phase with q and reaches maximum value at 1.  
Current and voltage are both positive.  
So p = vci is positive.  
Energy is absorbed from the source during this quarter cycle as the capacitor is charged.  
The current i reverses its direction.  
"The accumulated charge is depleted i.e., the capacitor is discharged during this quarter cycle.  "
The voltage gets reduced but is still positive.  
The current is negative.  
"Their product, the power is negative.  "
The energy absorbed during the 1/4 cycle is returned during this quarter.  
One complete cycle of voltage/current.  
Note that the current leads the voltage.  
"As i continues to flow from A to B, the capacitor is charged to reversed polarity i.e., the plate B acquires positive and A acquires negative charge.  "
Both the current and the voltage are negative.  
Their product p is positive.  
The capacitor absorbs energy during this 1/4 cycle.  
The current i reverses its direction at 3 and flows from B to A.  
The accumulated charge is depleted and the magnitude of the voltage vc is reduced.  
vc becomes zero at 4 when the capacitor is fully discharged.  
The power is negative.  
Net energy absorbed is zero.  
Figure 7.12 shows a series LCR circuit connected to an ac source ε.  
"As usual, we take the voltage of the source to be v = vm sin ωt.  "
We want to determine the instantaneous current i and its phase relationship to the applied alternating voltage v.  
We shall solve this problem by two methods.  
"First, we use the technique of phasors and in the second method, we solve Eq.  -LRB- 7.20 -RRB-  analytically to obtain the time — dependence of i.  "
FIGURE 7.12 A series LCR circuit connected to an ac source.  
"Phasor-diagram solution From the circuit shown in Fig. 7.12, we see that the resistor, inductor and capacitor are in series.  "
"Therefore, the ac current in each element is the same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase.  "
"Let it be i = im sin  -LRB- ωt + φ -RRB- , where φ is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and the current in the circuit.  "
"On the basis of what we have learned in the previous sections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.  "
Let I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by Eq.  -LRB- 7.21 -RRB- .  
"VL, VR, VC and I are shown in Fig. 7.13  -LRB- a -RRB-  with apppropriate phase-relations.  "
"The length of these phasors or the amplitude of VR, VC and VL are: vRm = im R, vCm = im XC, vLm = im XL.  "
The voltage Equation  -LRB- 7.20 -RRB-  for the circuit can be written as vL + vR + vC = v.  
The phasor relation whose vertical component gives the above equation is VL + VR + VC = V.  
This relation is represented in Fig. 7.13 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
Since V is represented as the hypotenuse of a right-traingle whose sides are VR and  -LRB- VC + VL -RRB-   
"Since phasor I is always parallel to phasor VR, the phase angle φ is the angle between VR and V and can be determined from Fig. 7.14.  "
This is called Impedance diagram which is a right-triangle with Z as its hypotenuse.  
Equation 7.25 -LRB- a -RRB-  gives the amplitude of the current and Eq.  -LRB- 7.27 -RRB-  gives the phase angle.  
"With these, Eq.  -LRB- 7.21 -RRB-  is completely specified.  "
"If XC  _GREAT_GT;  XL, φ is positive and the circuit is predominantly capacitive.  "
"Consequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage.  "
"If XC  _LESS_LT;  XL, φ is negative and the circuit is predominantly inductive.  "
"Consequently, the current in the circuit lags the source voltage.  "
Figure 7.15 shows the phasor diagram and variation of v and i with ωt for the case XC  _GREAT_GT;  XL.  
"Thus, we have obtained the amplitude and phase of current for an LCR series circuit using the technique of phasors.  "
But this method of analyzing ac circuits suffers from certain disadvantages.  
"First, the phasor diagram say nothing about the initial condition.  "
The solution so obtained is called the steady-state solution.  
This is not a general solution.  
"Additionally, we do have a transient solution which exists even for v = 0.  "
The general solution is the sum of the transient solution and the steady-state solution.  
"After a sufficiently long time, the effects of the transient solution die out and the behavior of the circuit is described by the steady-state solution.  "
The voltage equation for the circuit is vm sin ωt.  
"We know that i = dq/dt; Therefore, di/dt = d2q/dt2.  "
"This is like the equation for a forced, damped oscillator,  -LRB- see Eq. {14.37 -LRB- b -RRB- } in Class XI Physics Textbook -RRB- .  "
Let us assume a solution q = qm sin -LRB- ωt + θ -RRB- .  
"Thus, the analytical solution for the amplitude and phase of the current in the circuit agrees with that obtained by the technique of phasors.  "
An interesting characteristic of the series RLC circuit is the phenomenon of resonance.  
The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency.  
This frequency is called the system's natural frequency.  
"If such a system is driven by an energy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the amplitude of oscillation is found to be large.  "
A familiar example of this phenomenon is a child on a swing.  
Then the swing has a natural frequency for swinging back and forth like a pendulum.  
"For an RLC circuit driven with voltage of amplitude vm and frequency ω, we found that the current amplitude is given by with Xc = 1/ωC and XL = ωL.  "
"So if ω is varied, then at a particular frequency ω0, Xc = XL, and the impedance is minimum.  "
This frequency is called the resonant frequency.  
"At resonant frequency, the current amplitude is maximum; im = vm/R.  "
We see that the current amplitude is maximum at the resonant frequency.  
Suppose we choose a value of ω for which the current amplitude is times its maximum value.  
"At this value, the power dissipated by the circuit becomes half.  "
The difference ω1 — ω2 = 2Δω is often called the bandwidth of the circuit.  
The quantity  -LRB- ω0/2Δω -RRB-  is regarded as a measure of the sharpness of resonance.  
"The smaller the Δω, the sharper or narrower is the resonance.  "
"The ratio ω is also called the quality factor, Q of the circuit.  "
"Case  -LRB- ii -RRB-  Purely inductive or capacitive circuit: If the circuit contains only an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between voltage and current is π/2.  "
"Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit.  "
This current is sometimes referred to as wattless current.  
"Case  -LRB- iii -RRB-  LCR series circuit: In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is given by Eq.  -LRB- 7.38 -RRB-  where φ = tan—1 -LRB- Xc — XL -RRB- /R.  "
"So, φ may be non-zero in a RL or RC or RCL circuit.  "
"Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in the resistor.  "
"That is, maximum power is dissipated in a circuit  -LRB- through R -RRB-  at resonance.  "
"We know that a capacitor and an inductor can store electrical and magnetic energy, respectively.  "
Let a capacitor be charged q m  -LRB- at t = 0 -RRB-  and connected to an inductor as shown in Fig. 7.18.  
"The moment the circuit is completed, the charge on the capacitor starts decreasing, giving rise to current in the circuit.  "
Let q and i be the charge and current in the circuit at time t.  
This equation has the form for a simple harmonic oscillator.  
"The charge, therefore, oscillates with a natural frequency and varies sinusoidally with time.  "
Let us now try to visualise how this oscillation takes place in the circuit.  
Figure 7.19  -LRB- a -RRB-  shows a capacitor with initial charge q m connected to an ideal inductor.  
The electrical energy stored in the charged capacitor.  
"Since, there is no current in the circuit, energy in the inductor is zero.  "
The oscillations in an LC circuit are analogous to the oscillation of a block at the end of a spring.  
The figure depicts one-half of a cycle.  
"At t = 0, the switch is closed and the capacitor starts to discharge  "
"As the current increases, it sets up a magnetic field in the inductor and thereby, some energy gets stored in the inductor in the form of magnetic energy.  "
"As the current reaches its maximum value im,  -LRB- at t = T/4 -RRB-  as in Fig. 7.19  -LRB- c -RRB- , all the energy is stored in the magnetic field.  "
You can easily check that the maximum electrical energy equals the maximum magnetic energy.  
The capacitor now has no charge and hence no energy.  
"The current now starts charging the capacitor, as in Fig. 7.19  -LRB- d -RRB- .  "
This process continues till the capacitor is fully charged.  
But it is charged with a polarity opposite to its initial state in Fig. 7.19  -LRB- a -RRB- .  
The whole process just described will now repeat itself till the system reverts to its original state.  
"Thus, the energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor.  "
The LC oscillation is similar to the mechanical oscillation of a block attached to a spring.  
The lower part of each figure in Fig. 7.19 depicts the corresponding stage of a mechanical system  -LRB- a block attached to a spring -RRB- .  
"So, x corresponds to q.  "
In case of a mechanical system F = ma = m -LRB- dv/dt -RRB-  = m -LRB- d2x/dt2 -RRB- .  
"For an electrical system, ε = —L -LRB- di/dt -RRB-  = —L -LRB- d2q/dt2 -RRB- .  "
"Comparing these two equations, we see that L is analogous to mass m.  "
L is a measure of resistance to change in current.  
"In case of LC circuit, and for mass on a spring,.  "
"So, 1/C is analogous to k.  "
The constant k -LRB- =F/x -RRB-  tells us the  -LRB- external -RRB-  force required to produce a unit displacement whereas 1/C  -LRB- = V/q -RRB-  tells us the potential difference required to store a unit charge.  
Table 7.1 gives the analogy between mechanical and electrical quantities.  
Note that the above discussion of LC oscillations is not realistic for two reasons:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Every inductor has some resistance.  
The effect of this resistance is to introduce a damping effect on the charge and current in the circuit and the oscillations finally die away.  
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  Even if the resistance were zero, the total energy of the system would not remain constant.  "
It is radiated away from the system in the form of electromagnetic waves  -LRB- discussed in the next chapter -RRB- .  
"In fact, radio and TV transmitters depend on this radiation.  "
"You may like to compare the treatment of a forced damped oscillator discussed in Section 14.10 of Class XI physics textbook, with that of an LCR circuit when an ac voltage is applied in it.  "
"When you use Eqs.  -LRB- 7.33 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 7.34 -RRB- , you will see that there is a perfect match.  "
You will come across numerous such situations in physics where diverse physical phenomena are represented by the same mathematical equation.  
"If you have dealt with one of them, and you come across another situation, you may simply replace the corresponding quantities and interpret the result in the new context.  "
We suggest that you may try to find more such parallel situations from different areas of physics.  
"One must, of course, be aware of the differences too.  "
"For many purposes, it is necessary to change  -LRB- or transform -RRB-  an alternating voltage from one to another of greater or smaller value.  "
This is done with a device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.  
"A transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.  "
One of the coils called the primary coil has Np turns.  
The other coil is called the secondary coil; it has Ns turns.  
Often the primary coil is the input coil and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.  
"When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary, the resulting current produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary and induces an emf in it.  "
The value of this emf depends on the number of turns in the secondary.  
We consider an ideal transformer in which the primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both primary and secondary windings.  
Let φ be the flux in each turn in the core at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage vp is applied to it.  
"Then the induced emf or voltage εs, in the secondary with Ns turns is φ.  "
"The alternating flux φ also induces an emf, called back emf in the primary.  "
"But εp = vp ; If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite since the primary has zero resistance  -LRB- as assumed -RRB- .  "
"If the secondary is an open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good approximation εs = vs where vs is the voltage across the secondary.  "
"If the transformer is assumed to be 100 % efficient  -LRB- no energy losses -RRB- , the power input is equal to the power output.  "
"Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation, since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than 95 %.  "
"Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.  "
"That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary  -LRB- Ns  _GREAT_GT;  Np -RRB- , the voltage is stepped up  -LRB- Vs  _GREAT_GT;  Vp -RRB- .  "
This type of arrangement is called a step-up transformer.  
"However, in this arrangement, there is less current in the secondary than in the primary  -LRB- Np/Ns  _LESS_LT;  1 and Is  _LESS_LT;  Ip -RRB- .  "
"For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and the secondary has 200 turns, Ns/Np = 2 and Np/Ns =1/2.  "
"In this case, Vs  _LESS_LT;  Vp and Is  _GREAT_GT;  Ip ; That is, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current is increased.  "
The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers  -LRB- without any energy losses -RRB- .  
It can be reduced by winding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.  
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire  -LRB- I2R -RRB- .  "
"In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimized by using thick wire.  "
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents in the iron core and causes heating.  
The effect is reduced by having a laminated core.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by the alternating magnetic field.  
The resulting expenditure of energy in the core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic material which has a low hysteresis loss.  
The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over long distances is done with the use of transformers.  
"The voltage output of the generator is stepped-up  -LRB- so that current is reduced and consequently, the I2R loss is cut down -RRB- .  "
It is then transmitted over long distances to an area sub-station near the consumers.  
There the voltage is stepped down.  
It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations and utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.  
"In Chapter 4, we learned that an electric current produces magnetic field and that two current-carrying wires exert a magnetic force on each other. "
"Further, in Chapter 6, we have seen that a magnetic field changing with time gives rise to an electric field. "
Is the converse also true? 
Does an electric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? 
"James Clerk Maxwell  -LRB- 1831-1879 -RRB- , argued that this was indeed the case — not only an electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic field. "
"While applying the Ampere's circuital law to find magnetic field at a point outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell noticed an inconsistency in the Ampere's circuital law. "
"He suggested the existence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement current to remove this inconsistency. "
"Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic fields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. "
These equations are known as Maxwell's equations. 
"Together with the Lorentz force formula  -LRB- Chapter 4 -RRB- , they mathematically express all the basic laws of electromagnetism. "
"The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell's equations is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are  -LRB- coupled -RRB-  time-varying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. "
"The speed the speed of light  -LRB- 3×108m/s -RRB- , obtained from optical measurements. "
This led to the remarkable conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. 
"Maxwell's work thus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and light. "
"Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves. "
Its technological use by Marconi and others led in due course to the revolution in communication that we are witnessing today. 
"In this chapter, we first discuss the need for displacement current and its consequences. "
Then we present a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves. 
"The broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves, stretching from γ rays  -LRB- wavelength ~10—12 m -RRB-  to long radio waves  -LRB- wavelength ~106m -RRB-  is described. "
How the electromagnetic waves are sent and received for communication is discussed in Chapter 15. 
We have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current produces a magnetic field around it. 
"Maxwell showed that for logical consistency, a changing electric field must also produce a magnetic field. "
"This effect is of great importance because it explains the existence of radio waves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other forms of electromagnetic waves. "
To see how a changing electric field gives rise to a magnetic field. 
Let us consider the process of charging of a capacitor and apply Ampere's circuital law to find magnetic field at a point outside the capacitor. 
Figure 8.1 -LRB- a -RRB-  shows a parallel plate capacitor C which is a part of circuit through which a time-dependent current i -LRB- t -RRB-  flows. 
"Let us find the magnetic field at a point such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate capacitor. "
"So we have B -LRB- 2πr -RRB-  = µ0i -LRB- t -RRB-   -LRB- 8.2 -RRB-  Now, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. "
Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box  -LRB- without the lid -RRB-   -LRB- Fig.8.1 -LRB- c -RRB-  -RRB- . 
"So we have a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a point P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero. "
"Since the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere's circuital law, this law must be missing something. "
"The missing term must be such that one gets the same magnetic field at point P, no matter what surface is used. "
We can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at Fig.8.1 -LRB- c -RRB- . 
Is there anything passing through the surface S between the plates of the capacitor? 
"Yes, of course, the electric field! "
"If the plates of the capacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the electric field E between the plates is  -LRB- Q/A -RRB- /ε0  -LRB- see Eq. 2.41 -RRB- . "
The field is perpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1  -LRB- c -RRB- . 
"It has the same magnitude over the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. "
"If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B obtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere's law. "
B at the point P is non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. 
"B at a point P outside the plates  -LRB- Fig.8.1 -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB-  is the same as at a point M just inside, as it should be. "
The current carried by conductors due to flow of charges is called conduction current. 
"The current, given by Eq. -LRB- 8.4 -RRB- , is a new term, and is due to changing electric field  -LRB- or electric displacement, an old term still used sometimes -RRB- . "
"It is, therefore, called displacement current or Maxwell's displacement current. "
Figure 8.2 shows the electric and magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above. 
The generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. 
The arrows show uniform electric field between the capacitor plates. 
"The source of a magnetic field is not just the conduction electric current due to flowing charges, but also the time rate of change of electric field. "
"More precisely, the total current i is the sum of the conduction current denoted by ic, and the displacement current denoted by id  -LRB- =ε0  -LRB- dΦE/dt -RRB-  -RRB- . "
"In explicit terms, this means that outside the capacitor plates, we have only conduction current ic = i, and no displacement current, i.e., id=0. "
"On the other hand, inside the capacitor, there is no conduction current, i.e., ic=0, and there is only displacement current, so that id=i. "
"In all respects, the displacement current has the same physical effects as the conduction current. "
"In some cases, for example, steady electric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may be zero since the electric field E does not change with time. "
"In other cases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction and displacement currents may be present in different regions of space. "
"In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same region of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating medium. "
"Most interestingly, there may be large regions of space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a displacement current due to time-varying electric fields. "
"In such a region, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no  -LRB- conduction -RRB-  current source nearby! "
The prediction of such a displacement current can be verified experimentally. 
The displacement current has  -LRB- literally -RRB-  far reaching consequences. 
One thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and magnetism are now more symmetrical. 
Faraday's law of induction states that there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux. 
"Now, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit charge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence of an electric field. "
"So, we can rephrase Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise to an electric field. "
"Then, the fact that an electric field changing with time gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is a consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic field. "
"Thus, time-dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each other! "
"Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell law give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current being the total current, as in Eq.  -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- . "
"One very important consequence of this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we discuss qualitatively in the next section. "
Neither stationary charges nor charges in uniform motion  -LRB- steady currents -RRB-  can be sources of electromagnetic waves. 
"The former produces only electrostatic fields, while the latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time. "
It is an important result of Maxwell's theory that accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves. 
Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency  -LRB- An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge. -RRB-  
"This produces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and so on. "
"The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space. "
The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the frequency of oscillation of the charge. 
The energy associated with the propagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source — the accelerated charge. 
"From the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. "
"We might think that all we needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate at the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. "
"But, alas, that is not possible. "
"The frequency of yellow light is about 6×1014Hz, while the frequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about 1011Hz. "
Hertz's successful experimental test of Maxwell's theory created a sensation and sparked off other important works in this field. 
Two important achievements in this connection deserve mention. 
"Seven years after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working at Calcutta  -LRB- now Kolkata -RRB- , succeeded in producing and observing electromagnetic waves of much shorter wavelength  -LRB- 25mm to 5mm -RRB- . "
"His experiment, like that of Hertz's, was confined to the laboratory. "
"At around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy followed Hertz's work and succeeded in transmitting electromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres. "
Marconi's experiment marks the beginning of the field of communication using electromagnetic waves. 
"Nature of electromagnetic waves It can be shown from Maxwell's equations that electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation. "
"It appears reasonable, say from our discussion of the displacement current. "
Consider Fig.8.2. 
The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor is directed perpendicular to the plates. 
The magnetic field this gives rise to via the displacement current is along the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor plates. 
So B and E are perpendicular in this case. 
This is a general feature. 
"The electric field Ex is along the x-axis, and varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. "
"The magnetic field By is along the y-axis, and again varies sinusoidally with z. "
"The electric and magnetic fields Ex and By are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction z of propagation. "
The speed of propagation of the wave is  -LRB- ω/k -RRB- . 
"Electric and magnetic fields, oscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in vacuum. "
"But what if a material medium is actually there ; We know that light, an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. "
We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of one medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of light in the two media. 
The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an important fundamental constant. 
"Namely, the metre is now defined as the distance traveled by light in vacuum in a time  -LRB- 1/c -RRB-  seconds =  -LRB- 2.99792458×108 -RRB- —1 seconds. "
This has come about for the following reason. 
"The basic unit of time can be defined very accurately in terms of some atomic frequency, i.e., frequency of light emitted by an atom in a particular process. "
The basic unit of length is harder to define as accurately in a direct way. 
"Earlier measurement of c using earlier units of length  -LRB- metre rods, etc. -RRB-  converged to a value of about 2.9979246×108 m/s. "
"Since c is such a strongly fixed number, unit of length can be defined in terms of c and the unit of time! "
"Hertz not only showed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but also demonstrated that the waves, which had wavelength ten million times that of the light waves, could be diffracted, refracted and polarised. "
"Thus, he conclusively established the wave nature of the radiation. "
"Further, he produced stationary electromagnetic waves and determined their wavelength by measuring the distance between two successive nodes. "
The fact that electromagnetic waves are polarised can be easily seen in the response of a portable AM radio to a broadcasting station. 
"If an AM radio has a telescopic antenna, it responds to the electric part of the signal. "
"When the antenna is turned horizontal, the signal will be greatly diminished. "
"Some portable radios have horizontal antenna  -LRB- usually inside the case of radio -RRB- , which are sensitive to the magnetic component of the electromagnetic wave. "
Such a radio must remain horizontal in order to receive the signal. 
"In such cases, response also depends on the orientation of the radio with respect to the station. "
Do electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum like other waves? 
"We have seen in chapter 2 that in a region of free space with electric field E, there is an energy density  -LRB- ε0E2/2 -RRB- . "
"Similarly, as seen in Chapter 6, associated with a magnetic field B is a magnetic energy density  -LRB- B2/2µ0 -RRB- . "
"As electromagnetic wave contains both electric and magnetic fields, there is a non-zero energy density associated with it. "
Now consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave  -LRB- Fig. 8.4 -RRB- . 
"Light carries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on the earth. "
"At the time Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, the only familiar electromagnetic waves were the visible light waves. "
The existence of ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. 
"By the end of the nineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered. "
"We now know that, e lectromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X-rays, gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. "
The classification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic spectrum  -LRB- Fig.8.5 -RRB- . 
There is no sharp division between one kind of wave and the next. 
The classification is based roughly on how the waves are produced and/or detected. 
"FIGURE 8.5 The electromagnetic spectrum, with common names for various part of it. "
The various regions do not have sharply defined boundaries. 
"Electromagnetic spectrum http://www.fnal.gov/pub/inquiring/more/light http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/We briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in order of decreasing wavelengths. "
Radio waves are produced by the accelerated motion of charges in conducting wires. 
They are used in radio and television communication systems. 
They are generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz. 
The AM  -LRB- amplitude modulated -RRB-  band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. 
Higher frequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave bands. 
TV waves range from 54 MHz to 890 MHz. 
The FM  -LRB- frequency modulated -RRB-  radio band extends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. 
Cellular phones use radio waves to transmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency  -LRB- UHF -RRB-  band. 
How these waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15. 
"Due to their short wavelengths, they are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. "
Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic application of these waves. 
This raises the temperature of any food containing water. 
The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation contains a part known as microwaves. 
These waves have frequency and energy smaller than visible light and wavelength larger than it. 
What is the principle of a microwave oven and how does it work? 
Our objective is to cook food or warm it up. 
"All food items such as fruit, vegetables, meat, cereals, etc., contain water as a constituent. "
"Now, what does it mean when we say that a certain object has become warmer? "
"When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of the random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or rotate with higher energies. "
"The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about 300 crore hertz, which is 3 gigahertz  -LRB- GHz -RRB- . "
"If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules absorb this radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. "
"These molecules share this energy with neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food. "
One should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because of the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. 
Metals may also melt from heating. 
"The porcelain container remains unaffected and cool, because its large molecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies, and thus can not absorb microwaves. "
"Hence, they do not get heated up. "
"Thus, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of appropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. "
This way energy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. 
Infrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. 
This band lies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible spectrum. 
Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. 
"This is because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb infrared waves  -LRB- many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorb infrared waves -RRB- . "
"After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is, they heat up and heat their surroundings. "
Our eyes are sensitive to this range of wavelengths. 
Different animals are sensitive to different range of wavelengths. 
"For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the ' visible ' range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet. "
It covers wavelengths ranging from about 4×10—7 m  -LRB- 400 nm -RRB-  down to 6×10—10 m  -LRB- 0.6 nm -RRB- . 
Ultraviolet  -LRB- UV -RRB-  radiation is produced by special lamps and very hot bodies. 
The sun is an important source of ultraviolet light. 
"But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the atmosphere at an altitude of about 40—50 km. "
UV light in large quantities has harmful effects on humans. 
"Exposure to UV radiation induces the production of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. "
UV radiation is absorbed by ordinary glass. 
"Hence, one can not get tanned or sunburn through glass windows. "
Welders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows to protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs. 
UV lamps are used to kill germs in water purifiers. 
Beyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-ray region. 
We are familiar with X-rays because of its medical applications. 
It covers wavelengths from about 10—8 m  -LRB- 10 nm -RRB-  down to 10—13 m  -LRB- 10—4 nm -RRB- . 
One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metal target by high energy electrons. 
X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in medicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. 
"Because X-rays damage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to avoid unnecessary or over exposure. "
This high frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions and also emitted by radioactive nuclei. 
They are used in medicine to destroy cancer cells. 
"Table 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, their production and detections. "
"As mentioned earlier, the demarcation between different region is not sharp and there are over laps. "
Nature has endowed the human eye  -LRB- retina -RRB-  with the sensitivity to detect electromagnetic waves within a small range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  
Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the spectrum  -LRB- wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm -RRB-  is called light.  
It is mainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret the world around us.  
There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience.  
"First, that it travels with enormous speed and second, that it travels in a straight line.  "
The speed of light in vacuum is the highest speed attainable in nature.  
How to reconcile the two facts?  
The answer is that the wavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects that we encounter commonly  -LRB- generally of the order of a few cm or larger -RRB- .  
"In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be considered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining them.  "
"The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays constitutes a beam of light.  "
"In this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction and dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light.  "
"Using the basic laws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by plane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces.  "
"We then go on to describe the construction and working of some important optical instruments, including the human eye.  "
"Newton's fundamental contributions to mathematics, mechanics, and gravitation often blind us to his deep experimental and theoretical study of light.  "
He made pioneering contributions in the field of optics.  
He further assumed that corpuscles of light were massless elastic particles.  
"With his understanding of mechanics, he could come up with a simple model of reflection and refraction.  "
It is a common observation that a ball bouncing from a smooth plane surface obeys the laws of reflection.  
"When this is an elastic collision, the magnitude of the velocity remains the same.  "
"As the surface is smooth, there is no force acting parallel to the surface, so the component of momentum in this direction also remains the same.  "
"Only the component perpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed in reflection.  "
An incoming wave can be divided into two weaker waves at the boundary between air and water.  
We are familiar with the laws of reflection.  
"Also that the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie in the same plane  -LRB- Fig. 9.1 -RRB- .  "
These laws are valid at each point on any reflecting surface whether plane or curved.  
"However, we shall restrict our discussion to the special case of curved surfaces, that is, spherical surfaces.  "
The normal in this case is to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface at the point of incidence.  
We have already studied that the geometric center of a spherical mirror is called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical center.  
The line joining the pole and the center of curvature of the spherical mirror is known as the principal axis is the line joining the optical center with its principal focus as you will see later.  
"To derive the relevant formulae for reflection by spherical mirrors and refraction by spherical lenses, we must first adopt a sign convention for measuring distances.  "
The distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are taken as positive and those measured in the direction opposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative  -LRB- Fig. 9.2 -RRB- .  
The heights measured upwards with respect to x-axis and normal to the principal axis  -LRB- x-axis -RRB-  of the mirror / lens are taken as positive  -LRB- Fig. 9.2 -RRB- .  
The heights measured downwards are taken as negative.  
"With a common accepted convention, it turns out that a single formula for spherical mirrors and a single formula for spherical lenses can handle all different cases.  "
"Figure 9.3 shows what happens when a parallel beam of light is incident on  -LRB- a -RRB-  a concave mirror, and  -LRB- b -RRB-  a convex mirror.  "
"We assume that the rays are paraxial, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror and make small angles with the principal axis.  "
The reflected rays converge at a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror  -LRB- Fig. 9.3  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"For a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F on its principal axis  -LSB- Fig. 9.3  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RSB- .  "
The point F is called the principal focus of the mirror.  
This is called the focal plane of the mirror  -LSB- Fig. 9.3  -LRB- c -RRB-  -RSB- .  
The geometry of reflection of an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4.  
Let C be the center of curvature of the mirror.  
An image is thus a point-to-point correspondence with the object established through reflection and/or refraction.  
"In practice, however, it is convenient to choose any two of the following rays:  -LRB- i -RRB-  The ray from the point which is parallel to the principal axis.  "
The reflected ray goes through the focus of the mirror.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  The ray passing through the center of curvature of a concave mirror or appearing to pass through it for a convex mirror.  
The reflected ray simply retraces the path.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  The ray passing through  -LRB- or directed towards -RRB-  the focus of the concave mirror or appearing to pass through  -LRB- or directed towards -RRB-  the focus of a convex mirror.  
The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  The ray incident at any angle at the pole.  
The reflected ray follows laws of reflection.  
Figure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays.  
"It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A. An infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions.  "
"We now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object distance  -LRB- u -RRB- , image distance  -LRB- v -RRB-  and the focal length  -LRB- f -RRB- .  "
" -LRB- For paraxial rays, MP can be considered to be a straight line perpendicular to CP. -RRB-   "
We now apply the sign convention.  
We note that light travels from the object to the mirror MPN.  
"Hence, all the three will have negative signs.  "
The size of the image relative to the size of the object is another important quantity to consider.  
"We have derived here the mirror equation, Eq.  -LRB- 9.7 -RRB- , and the magnification formula, Eq.  -LRB- 9.9 -RRB- , for the case of real, inverted image formed by a concave mirror.  "
"With the proper use of sign convention, these are, in fact, valid for all the cases of reflection by a spherical mirror  -LRB- concave or convex -RRB-  whether the image formed is real or virtual.  "
Figure 9.6 shows the ray diagrams for virtual image formed by a concave and convex mirror.  
You should verify that Eqs.  -LRB- 9.7 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 9.9 -RRB-  are valid for these cases as well.  
A ray of light represents a beam.  
"The direction of propagation of an obliquely incident ray of light that enters the other medium, changes at the interface of the two media.  "
This phenomenon is called refraction of light.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant.  
"Remember that the angles of incidence  -LRB- i -RRB-  and refraction  -LRB- r -RRB-  are the angles that the incident and its refracted ray make with the normal, respectively.  "
Equation  -LRB- 9.10 -RRB-  is the well-known Snell's law of refraction.  
This is the case when incident ray in a denser medium refracts into a rarer medium ;  
"For a rectangular slab, refraction takes place at two interfaces  -LRB- air-glass and glass-air -RRB- .  "
Another familiar observation is that the bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be raised  -LRB- Fig. 9.10 -RRB- .  
The refraction of light through the atmosphere is responsible for many interesting phenomena.  
"For example, the sun is visible a little before the actual sunrise and until a little after the actual sunset due to refraction of light through the atmosphere  -LRB- Fig. 9.11 -RRB- .  "
By actual sunrise we mean the actual crossing of the horizon by the sun.  
Figure 9.11 shows the actual and apparent positions of the sun with respect to the horizon.  
The figure is highly exaggerated to show the effect.  
The refractive index of air with respect to vacuum is 1.00029.  
The apparent flattening  -LRB- oval shape -RRB-  of the sun at sunset and sunrise is also due to the same phenomenon.  
"When light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium at the interface, it is partly reflected back into the same medium and partly refracted to the second medium.  "
Some typical critical angles are listed in Table 9.1.  
"All optical phenomena can be demonstrated very easily with the use of a laser torch or pointer, which is easily available nowadays.  "
Take a glass beaker with clear water in it.  
"Stir the water a few times with a piece of soap, so that it becomes a little turbid.  "
Take a laser pointer and shine its beam through the turbid water.  
You will find that the path of the beam inside the water shines brightly.  
Shine the beam from below the beaker such that it strikes at the upper water surface at the other end.  
This is total internal reflection at its simplest.  
"Pour this water in a long test tube and shine the laser light from top, as shown in Fig. 9.13  -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
Adjust the direction of the laser beam such that it is totally internally reflected every time it strikes the walls of the tube.  
This is similar to what happens in optical fibers.  
Take care not to look into the laser beam directly and not to point it at anybody's face.  
" -LRB- i -RRB-  Mirage: On hot summer days, the air near the ground becomes hotter than the air at higher levels.  "
The refractive index of air increases with its density.  
"Hotter air is less dense, and has smaller refractive index than the cooler air.  "
"If the air currents are small, that is, the air is still, the optical density at different layers of air increases with height.  "
"As a result, light from a tall object such as a tree, passes through a medium whose refractive index decreases towards the ground.  "
"To a distant observer, the light appears to be coming from somewhere below the ground.  "
"The observer naturally assumes that light is being reflected from the ground, say, by a pool of water near the tall object.  "
Such inverted images of distant tall objects cause an optical illusion to the observer.  
This phenomenon is called mirage.  
This type of mirage is especially common in hot deserts.  
"Some of you might have noticed that while moving in a bus or a car during a hot summer day, a distant patch of road, especially on a highway, appears to be wet.  "
"But, you do not find any evidence of wetness when you reach that spot.  "
This is also due to mirage.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Diamond: Diamonds are known for their spectacular brilliance.  
Their brilliance is mainly due to the total internal reflection of light inside them.  
Diamonds found in nature rarely exhibit the brilliance for which they are known.  
It is the technical skill of a diamond cutter which makes diamonds to sparkle so brilliantly.  
"By cutting the diamond suitably, multiple total internal reflections can be made to occur.  "
Such a prism is also used to invert images without changing their size  -LSB- Fig. 9.15  -LRB- c -RRB-  -RSB- .  
"In the first two cases, the critical angle i must be less than 45º.  "
We see from Table 9.1 that this is true for both crown glass and dense flint glass.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Optical fibers: Now-a-days optical fibers are extensively used for transmitting audio and video signals through long distances.  
Optical fibers too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reflection.  
Optical fibers are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz fibers.  
Each fiber consists of a core and cladding.  
The refractive index of the material of the core is higher than that of the cladding.  
The fibers in such decorative lamps are optical fibers.  
The main requirement in fabricating optical fibers is that there should be very little absorption of light as it travels for long distances inside them.  
This has been achieved by purification and special preparation of materials such as quartz.  
"In silica glass fibers, it is possible to transmit more than 95 % of the light over a fiber length of 1 km.  "
 -LRB- Compare with what you expect for a block of ordinary window glass 1 km thick. -RRB-   
We have so far considered refraction at a plane interface.  
We shall now consider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media.  
An infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar and the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the surface.  
"Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the point of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical surface at that point and, therefore, passes through its center of curvature.  "
We first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and follow it by thin lenses.  
A thin lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical.  
"Applying the formula for image formation by a single spherical surface successively at the two surfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker's formula and then the lens formula.  "
"As before, we take the aperture  -LRB- or the lateral size -RRB-  of the surface to be small compared to other distances involved, so that small angle approximation can be made.  "
"In particular, NM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of the perpendicular from the point N on the principal axis.  "
The wavelength region in which the body emits the radiation depends on its absolute temperature.  
"Radiation emitted by a hot body, for example, a tungsten filament lamp having temperature 2850 K are partly invisible and mostly in infrared  -LRB- or heat -RRB-  region.  "
As the temperature of the body increases radiation emitted by it is in visible region.  
"The energy versus wavelength distribution graph for a given body peaks at some wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of that body.  "
The measurement of light as perceived by human eye is called photometry.  
"Photometry is measurement of a physiological phenomenon, being the stimulus of light as received by the human eye, transmitted by the optic nerves and analyzed by the brain.  "
"The main physical quantities in photometry are  -LRB- i -RRB-  the luminous intensity of the source,  -LRB- ii -RRB-  the luminous flux or flow of light from the source, and  -LRB- iii -RRB-  illuminance of the surface.  "
The SI unit of luminous intensity  -LRB- I -RRB-  is candela  -LRB- cd -RRB- .  
"If a light source emits one candela of luminous intensity into a solid angle of one steradian, the total luminous flux emitted into that solid angle is one lumen  -LRB- lm -RRB- .  "
A standard 100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens.  
"In photometry, the only parameter, which can be measured directly is illuminance.  "
Most light meters measure this quantity.  
"A quantity named luminance  -LRB- L -RRB- , is used to characterise the brightness of emitting or reflecting flat surfaces.  "
Figure 9.18  -LRB- a -RRB-  shows the geometry of image formation by a double convex lens.  
The image formation can be seen in terms of two steps:  -LRB- i -RRB-  The first refracting surface forms the image I 1 of the object O  -LSB- Fig. 9.18  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RSB- .  
The image I 1 acts as a virtual object for the second surface that forms the image at I  -LSB- Fig. 9.18  -LRB- c -RRB-  -RSB- .  
"Though we derived it for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both convex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images.  "
"It is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F ′, of a double convex or concave lens are equidistant from the optical center.  "
"The focus on the side of the  -LRB- original -RRB-  source of light is called the first focal point, whereas the other is called the second focal point;  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  A ray of light, passing through the optical center of the lens, emerges without any deviation after refraction.  "
"Figures 9.19  -LRB- a -RRB-  and  -LRB- b -RRB-  illustrate these rules for a convex and a concave lens, respectively.  "
Here again it must be remembered that each point on an object gives out infinite number of rays.  
All these rays will pass through the same image point after refraction at the lens.  
"Magnification  -LRB- m -RRB-  produced by a lens is defined, like that for a mirror, as the ratio of the size of the image to that of the object.  "
"Power of a lens is a measure of the convergence or divergence, which a lens introduces in the light falling on it.  "
"Clearly, a lens of shorter focal length bends the incident light more, while converging it in case of a convex lens and diverging it in case of a concave lens.  "
The power of a lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre.  
Power of a lens is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens.  
Let the object be placed at a point O beyond the focus of the first lens A  -LRB- Fig. 9.21 -RRB- .  
The first lens produces an image at I 1.  
"Since image I 1 is real, it serves as a virtual object for the second lens B, producing the final image at I.  "
"It must, however, be borne in mind that formation of image by the first lens is presumed only to facilitate determination of the position of the final image.  "
"In fact, the direction of rays emerging from the first lens gets modified in accordance with the angle at which they strike the second lens.  "
"Since the lenses are thin, we assume the optical centres of the lenses to be coincident.  "
where P is the net power of the lens combination.  
Combination of lenses helps to obtain diverging or converging lenses of desired magnification ; It also enhances sharpness of the image.  
Figure 9.23 shows the passage of light through a triangular prism ABC.  
"In the quadrilateral AQNR, two of the angles  -LRB- at the vertices Q and R -RRB-  are right angles.  "
"Therefore, the sum of the other angles of the quadrilateral is 180º.  "
"Thus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence.  "
A plot between the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in Fig. 9.24.  
"You can see that, in general, any given value of δ, except for i=e, corresponds to two values i and hence of e.  "
"This, in fact, is expected from the symmetry of i and e in Eq.  -LRB- 9.35 -RRB- , i.e.,δ remains the same if i and e are interchanged.  "
"Physically, this is related to the fact that the path of ray in Fig. 9.23 can be traced back, resulting in the same angle of deviation.  "
"At the minimum deviation D, the refracted ray inside the prism becomes parallel to its base.  "
"There is actually a continuous variation of color, but broadly, the different component colors that appear in sequence are: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red  -LRB- given by the acronym VIBGYOR -RRB- .  "
"The red light bends the least, while the violet light bends the most  -LRB- Fig. 9.25 -RRB- .  "
The phenomenon of splitting of light into its component colors is known as components of light is called the spectrum of light.  
The word spectrum is now used in a much more general sense:  
"we discussed in Chapter 8 the electro - magnetic spectrum over the large range of wavelengths,  "
"from γ-rays to radio waves, of which the spectrum of light  -LRB- visible spectrum -RRB-  is only a small part.  "
"Though the reason for appearance of spectrum is now common knowledge, it was a matter of much debate in the history of physics.  "
Does the prism itself create color in some way or does it only separate the colors already present in white light?  
"In a classic experiment known for its simplicity but great significance, Isaac Newton settled the issue once for all.  "
"He put another similar prism, but in an inverted position, and let the emergent beam from the first prism fall on the second prism  -LRB- Fig. 9.26 -RRB- .  "
The resulting emergent beam was found to be white light.  
"The explanation was clear — the first prism splits the white light into its component colors, while the inverted prism recombines them to give white light.  "
"Thus, white light itself consists of light of different colors, which are separated by the prism.  "
"It must be understood here that a ray of light, as defined mathematically, does not exist.  "
An actual ray is really a beam of many rays of light.  
Each ray splits into component colors when it enters the glass prism.  
"When those colored rays come out on the other side, they again produce a white beam.  "
We now know that color is associated with wavelength of light.  
Dispersion takes place because the refractive index of medium for different wavelengths  -LRB- colors -RRB-  is different.  
"For example, the bending of red component of white light is least while it is most for the violet.  "
"Equivalently, red light travels faster than violet light in a glass prism.  "
Table 9.2 gives the refractive indices for different wavelength for crown glass and flint glass.  
"Thick lenses could be assumed as made of many prisms, therefore, thick lenses show chromatic aberration due to dispersion of light.  "
The variation of refractive index with wavelength may be more pronounced in some media than the other.  
"In vacuum, of course, the speed of light is independent of wavelength.  "
"Thus, vacuum  -LRB- or air approximately -RRB-  is a non-dispersive medium in which all colors travel with the same speed.  "
This also follows from the fact that sunlight reaches us in the form of white light and not as its components.  
"On the other hand, glass is a dispersive medium.  "
The interplay of light with things around us gives rise to several beautiful phenomena.  
The spectacle of color that we see around us all the time is possible only due to sunlight.  
We describe some of them here from the point of view of physics.  
The rainbow is an example of the dispersion of sunlight by the water drops in the atmosphere.  
"This is a phenomenon due to combined effect of dispersion, refraction and reflection of sunlight by spherical water droplets of rain.  "
An observer can therefore see a rainbow only when his back is towards the sun.  
"In order to understand the formation of rainbows, consider Fig.  -LRB- 9.27  -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
"Sunlight is first refracted as it enters a raindrop, which causes the different wavelengths  -LRB- colors -RRB-  of white light to separate.  "
Longer wangelength of light  -LRB- red -RRB-  are bent the least while the shorter wavelength  -LRB- violet -RRB-  are bent the most.  
The reflected light is refracted again as it comes out of the drop as shown in the figure.  
"Further, the order of the colors is reversed in it as is clear from Fig. 9.27  -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
"As sunlight travels through the earth's atmosphere, it gets scattered  -LRB- changes its direction -RRB-  by the atmospheric particles.  "
Light of shorter wavelengths is scattered much more than light of longer wavelengths.  
 -LRB- The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.  
This is known as Rayleigh scattering -RRB- .  
"Hence, the bluish color predominates in a clear sky, since blue has a shorter wave - length than red and is scattered much more strongly.  "
"In fact, violet gets scattered even more than blue, having a shorter wavelength.  "
"But since our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, we see the sky blue.  "
Large particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere behave differently.  
"The relevant quantity here is the relative size of the wavelength of light λ , and the scatterer  -LRB- of typical size, say, a -RRB- .  "
"Thus, clouds which have droplets of water with a  _GREAT_GT;   _GREAT_GT;  λ are generally white.  "
"At sunset or sunrise, the sun's rays have to pass through a larger distance in the atmosphere  -LRB- Fig. 9.28 -RRB- .  "
Most of the blue and other shorter wavelengths are removed by scattering.  
"The least scattered light reaching our eyes, therefore, the sun looks reddish.  "
This explains the reddish appearance of the sun and full moon near the horizon.  
"A number of optical devices and instruments have been designed utilising reflecting and refracting properties of mirrors, lenses and prisms.  "
"Periscope, kaleidoscope, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes are some examples of optical devices and instruments that are in common use.  "
"Our eye is, of course, one of the most important optical device the nature has endowed us with.  "
"Starting with the eye, we then go on to describe the principles of working of the microscope and the telescope.  "
Figure 9.29  -LRB- a -RRB-  shows the eye.  
"Light enters the eye through a curved front surface, the cornea.  "
It passes through the pupil which is the central hole in the iris.  
The size of the pupil can change under control of muscles.  
The light is further focussed by the eye lens on the retina.  
The retina is a film of nerve fibers covering the curved back surface of the eye.  
The shape  -LRB- curvature -RRB-  and therefore the focal length of the lens can be modified somewhat by the ciliary muscles.  
"For example, when the muscle is relaxed, the focal length is about 2.5 cm and objects at infinity are in sharp focus on the retina.  "
This property of the eye is called accommodation.  
"If the object is too close to the eye, the lens can not curve enough to focus the image on to the retina, and the image is blurred.  "
"Thus, if an elderly person tries to read a book at about 25 cm from the eye, the image appears blurred.  "
This condition  -LRB- defect of the eye -RRB-  is called presbyopia.  
It is corrected by using a converging lens for reading.  
"Thus, our eyes are marvellous organs that have the capability to interpret incoming electromagnetic waves as images through a complex process.  "
These are our greatest assets and we must take proper care to protect them.  
Imagine the world without a pair of functional eyes.  
Yet many amongst us bravely face this challenge by effectively overcoming their limitations to lead a normal life.  
They deserve our appreciation for their courage and conviction.  
"In spite of all precautions and proactive action, our eyes may develop some defects due to various reasons.  "
We shall restrict our discussion to some common optical defects of the eye.  
"For example, the light from a distant object arriving at the eye-lens may get converged at a point in front of the retina.  "
This type of defect is called nearsightedness or myopia.  
This means that the eye is producing too much convergence in the incident beam.  
"To compensate this, we interpose a concave lens between the eye and the object, with the diverging effect desired to get the image focussed on the retina  -LSB- Fig. 9.29  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RSB- .  "
"Similarly, if the eye-lens focusses the incoming light at a point behind the retina, a convergent lens is needed to compensate for the defect in vision.  "
This defect is called farsightedness or hypermetropia  -LSB- Fig. 9.29  -LRB- c -RRB-  -RSB- .  
Another common defect of vision is called astigmatism.  
This occurs when the cornea is not spherical in shape.  
"For example, the cornea could have a larger curvature in the vertical plane than in the horizontal plane or vice-versa.  "
"If a person with such a defect in eye-lens looks at a wire mesh or a grid of lines, focussing in either the vertical or the horizontal plane may not be as sharp as in the other plane.  "
Astigmatism results in lines in one direction being well focussed while those in a perpendicular direction may appear distorted  -LSB- Fig. 9.29  -LRB- d -RRB-  -RSB- .  
Astigmatism can be corrected by using a cylindrical lens of desired radius of curvature with an appropriately directed axis.  
This defect can occur along with myopia or hypermetropia.  
A simple magnifier or microscope is a converging lens of small focal length  -LRB- Fig. 9.30 -RRB- .  
"The idea is to get an erect, magnified and virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed comfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more.  "
"If the object is at a distance f, the image is at infinity.  "
"However, if the object is at a distance slightly less than the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than infinity.  "
"Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered most suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye.  "
"We show both cases, the first in Fig. 9.30  -LRB- a -RRB- , and the second in Fig. 9.30  -LRB- b -RRB-  and  -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
"The linear magnification m, for the image formed at the near point D, by a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation.  "
"Now according to our sign convention, v is negative, and is equal in magnitude to D.  "
"This is also the ratio of the angle subtended by the image to that subtended by the object, if placed at D for comfortable viewing.  "
What a single-lens simple magnifier achieves is that it allows the object to be brought closer to the eye than D.  
We will now find the magnification when the image is at infinity.  
In this case we will have to obtained the angular magnification.  
Suppose the object has a height h.  
"The maximum angle it can subtend, and be clearly visible  -LRB- without a lens -RRB- , is when it is at the near point, i.e., a distance D  "
In subsequent discussions of optical instruments  -LRB- microscope and telescope -RRB-  we shall assume the image to be at infinity.  
A simple microscope has a limited maximum magnification  -LRB- ≤ 9 -RRB-  for realistic focal lengths.  
"For much larger magnifications, one uses two lenses, one compounding the effect of the other.  "
"In modern microscopes, multi - component lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to improve image quality by minimizing various optical aberrations  -LRB- defects -RRB-  in lenses.  "
The telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects  -LRB- Fig. 9.32 -RRB- .  
It also has an objective and an eyepiece.  
"But here, the objective has a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece.  "
Light from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed in the tube at its second focal point.  
The eyepiece magnifies this image producing a final inverted image.  
The magnifying power m is the ratio of the angle β subtended at the eye by the final image to the angle α which the object subtends at the lens or the eye.  
"In this case, the length of the telescope tube is fo + fe .  "
"Terrestrial telescopes have, in addition, a pair of inverting lenses to make the final image erect.  "
Refracting telescopes can be used both for terrestrial and astronomical observations.  
"For example, consider a telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece a focal length of 1 cm.  "
The main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light gathering power and its resolution or resolving power.  
The former clearly depends on the area of the objective.  
"With larger diameters, fainter objects can be observed.  "
"The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects distinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on the diameter of the objective.  "
"So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is to make them with objective of large diameter.  "
"It is at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, USA.  "
"Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore, difficult to make and support by their edges.  "
"Further, it is rather difficult and expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that are free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.  "
"For these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather than a lens for the objective.  "
It is a 2.34 m diameter reflecting telescope  -LRB- Cassegrain -RRB- .  
"It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.  "
"The largest reflecting telescopes in the world are the pair of Keck telescopes in Hawaii, USA, with a reflector of 10 metre in diameter.  "
In 1637 Descartes gave the corpuscular model of light and derived Snell's law.  
It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface.  
The corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light  -LRB- on refraction -RRB-  bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the second medium.  
This corpuscular model of light was further developed by Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of  
"the tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very often attributed to Newton.  "
"In 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the wave theory of light — it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in this chapter.  "
"As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain the phenomena of reflection and refraction;  "
"however, it predicted that on refraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be less in the second medium.  "
This is in contradiction to the prediction made by using the corpuscular model of light.  
It was much later confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of light in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the wave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850.  
The wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of Newton's authority  
Because light could travel through vacuum and it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate from one point to the other.  
"However, when Thomas Young performed his famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established that light is indeed a wave phenomenon.  "
"The wavelength of visible light was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the wavelength of yellow light is about 0.5 μm.  "
"Because of the smallness of the wavelength of visible light  -LRB- in comparison to the dimensions of typical mirrors and lenses -RRB- , light can be assumed to approximately travel in straight lines.  "
"This is the field of geometrical optics, which we had discussed in the previous chapter.  "
"After the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40 years or so, many experiments were carried out involving the interference and diffraction of lightwaves.  "
These experiments could only be satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light.  
"Thus, around the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed to be very well established.  "
"The only major difficulty was that since it was thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how could light waves propagate through vacuum.  "
This was explained when Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light.  
Maxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of electricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what is known as the wave equation from which he predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves.  
"From the wave equation, Maxwell could calculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found that the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed of light.  "
"From this, he propounded that light must be an electromagnetic wave.  "
"Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are associated with changing electric and magnetic fields  "
Changing electric field produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing magnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field.  
The changing electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of electromagnetic waves  -LRB- or light waves -RRB-  even in vacuum.  
In this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the Huygens principle and derive the laws of reflection and refraction.  
"In Sections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference which is based on the principle of superposition.  "
In Section 10.6 we will discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on Huygens - Fresnel principle.  
Finally in Section 10.7 we will discuss the phenomenon of polarisation which is based on the fact that the light waves are transverse electromagnetic waves.  
We would first define a wavefront:  
"When we drop a small stone on a calm pool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact.  "
Every point on the surface starts oscillating with time.  
"At any instant, a photograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the disturbance is maximum.  "
"Clearly, all points on such a circle are oscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the source.  "
"Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a wavefront,  "
Thus a wavefront is defined as a surface of constant phase.  
The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the source is called the speed of the wave.  
The energy of the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront.  
"At a large distance from the source, a Light travels in a straight line in Class VI; it does not do so in Class XII and beyond!  "
"Surprised, are n't you?  "
"In school, you are shown an experiment in which you take three cardboards with pinholes in them, place a candle on one side and look from the other side.  "
"If the flame of the candle and the three pinholes are in a straight line, you can see the candle.  "
"Even if one of them is displaced a little, you can not see the candle.  "
"This proves, so your teacher says, that light travels in a straight line.  "
"In the present book, there are two consecutive chapters, one on ray optics and the other on wave optics.  "
"Ray optics is based on rectilinear propagation of light, and deals with mirrors, lenses, reflection, refraction, etc..  "
"Then you come to the chapter on wave optics, and you are told that light travels as a wave, that it can bend around objects, it can diffract and interfere, etc..  "
"In optical region, light has a wavelength of about half a micrometre.  "
"If it encounters an obstacle of about this size, it can bend around it and can be seen on the other side.  "
Thus a micrometre size obstacle will not be able to stop a light ray.  
"If the obstacle is much larger, however, light will not be able to bend to that extent, and will not be seen on the other side.  "
"This is a property of a wave in general, and can be seen in sound waves too.  "
The sound wave of our speech has a wavelength of about 50 cm to 1 m.  
"If it meets an obstacle of the size of a few metres, it bends around it and reaches points behind the obstacle.  "
"But when it comes across a larger obstacle of a few hundred metres, such as a hillock, most of it is reflected and is heard as an echo.  "
Then what about the primary school experiment?  
"What happens there is that when we move any cardboard, the displacement is of the order of a few millimetres, which is much larger than the wavelength of light.  "
Hence the candle can not be seen.  
"If we are able to move one of the cardboards by a micrometer or less, light will be able to diffract, and the candle will still be seen.  "
One could add to the first sentence in this box: It learns how to bend as it grows up!  
Small portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have what is known as a plane wave  -LRB- Fig. 10.1  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"Now, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens principle allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time τ.  "
"Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction, which given the shape of the wafefront at any time allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time.  "
Let us consider a diverging wave and let F 1 F 2 represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at t = 0  -LRB- Fig. 10.2 -RRB- .  
"Now, according to Huygens principle, each point of the wavefront is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets emanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed of the wave.  "
"If we now draw a common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at t = τ.  "
The new wavefront shown as G 1 G 2 in Fig. 10.2 is again spherical with point O as the center.  
The above model has one shortcoming:we also have a backwave which is shown as D 1 D 2 in Fig. 10.2.  
Huygens argued that the amplitude of the secondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the backward direction.  
"By making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could explain the absence of the backwave.  "
"However, this adhoc assumption is not satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really justified from more rigorous wave theory.  "
"In a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the shape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium  -LRB- Fig. 10.3 -RRB- .  "
We will now use Huygens principle to derive the laws of refraction.  
"Let PP′ represent the surface separating medium 1 and medium 2, as shown in Fig. 10.4.  "
"Let v 1 and v 2 represent the speed of light in medium 1 and medium 2, respectively.  "
We assume a plane wavefront AB propagating in the direction A ′ A incident on the interface at an angle i as shown in the figure.  
Let τ be the time taken by the wavefront to travel the distance BC.  
Let CE represent a tangent plane drawn from the point C on to the sphere.  
"Then, AE = v 2 τ and CE would represent the refracted wavefront.  "
"If we now consider the triangles ABC and AEC, we readily obtain where i and r are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.  "
"Thus we obtain From the above equation, we get the important result  "
"This prediction is opposite to the prediction from the corpuscular model of light and as later experiments showed, the prediction of the wave theory is correct.  "
"Now, if c represents the speed of light in vacuum, then, are known as the refractive indices of medium 1 and medium 2, respectively.  "
"In terms of the refractive indices, Eq.  -LRB- 10.3 -RRB-  can be written as This is the Snell's law of refraction.  "
"Thus, The above equation implies that when a wave gets refracted into a denser medium  -LRB- v 1  _GREAT_GT;  v 2 -RRB-  the wavelength and the speed of propagation decrease but the frequency remains the same.  "
"We now consider refraction of a plane wave at a rarer medium, i.e., v 2  _GREAT_GT;  v 1.  "
Proceeding in an exactly similar manner we can construct a refracted wavefront as shown in Fig. 10.5.  
"The angle of refraction will now be greater than angle of incidence; however, we will still have n 1 sin i = n 2 sin r.  "
"We define an angle i by the following equation Thus, if i = i then sin r = 1 and r = 90 °.  "
"Obviously, for i  _GREAT_GT;  i, there can not be any refracted wave.  "
"The angle i is known as the critical angle and for all angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, we will not have any refracted wave and the wave will undergo what is known as total internal reflection.  "
The phenomenon of total internal reflection and its applications was discussed in Section 9.4.  
We next consider a plane wave AB incident at an angle i on a reflecting surface MN.  
If v represents the speed of the wave in the medium and if τ represents the time taken by the wavefront to advance from the point B to C then the distance BC = v τ  
In order the construct the reflected wavefront we draw a sphere of radius v τ from the point A as shown in Fig. 10.6.  
Let CE represent the tangent plane drawn from the point C to this sphere.  
"If we now consider the triangles EAC and BAC we will find that they are congruent and therefore, the angles i and r  -LRB- as shown in Fig. 10.6 -RRB-  would be equal.  "
This is the law of reflection.  
"Once we have the laws of reflection and refraction, the behavior of prisms, lenses, and mirrors can be understood.  "
These phenomena were discussed in detail in Chapter 9 on the basis of rectilinear propagation of light.  
Here we just describe the behavior of the wavefronts as they undergo reflection or refraction.  
we consider a plane wave passing through a thin prism.  
"Clearly, since the speed of light waves is less in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront  -LRB- which travels through the greatest thickness of glass -RRB-  will get delayed  "
Resulting in a tilt in the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure.  
we consider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens.  
The central part of the incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is delayed the most.  
The emerging wavefront has a depression at the center and therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point F which is known as the focus.  
A plane wave is incident on a concave mirror and on reflection we have a spherical wave converging to the focal point F.  
"In a similar manner, we can understand refraction and reflection by concave lenses and convex mirrors.  "
From the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a point on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same measured along any ray.  
We should mention here that one should be careful in constructing the wavefronts if the source  -LRB- or the observer -RRB-  is moving.  
"For example, if there is no medium and the source moves away from the observer, then later wavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer and hence take a longer time.  "
The time taken between the arrival of two successive wavefronts is hence longer at the observer than it is at the source.  
"Thus, when the source moves away from the observer the frequency as measured by the source will be smaller.  "
Astronomers call the increase in wavelength due to doppler effect as red shift since a wavelength in the middle of the visible region of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum.  
"When waves are received from a source moving towards the observer, there is an apparent decrease in wavelength, this is referred to as blue shift.  "
You have already encountered Doppler effect for sound waves in Chapter 15 of Class XI textbook.  
"For velocities small compared to the speed of light, we can use the same formulae which we use for sound waves.  "
"The fractional change in frequency Δν / ν is given by — v / c, where v radial is the component of the source velocity along the line joining the observer to the source relative to the observer,  "
v radial is considered positive when the source moves away from the observer.  
"Thus, the Doppler shift can be expressed as: The formula given above is valid only when the speed of the source is small compared to that of light.  "
"A more accurate formula for the Doppler effect which is valid even when the speeds are close to that of light, requires the use of Einstein's special theory of relativity.  "
The Doppler effect for light is very important in astronomy.  
It is the basis for the measurements of the radial velocities of distant galaxies.  
In this section we will discuss the interference pattern produced by the superposition of two waves.  
You may recall that we had discussed the superposition principle in Chapter 15 of your Class XI textbook.  
Consider two needles S 1 and S 2 moving periodically up and down in an identical fashion in a trough of water  -LRB- Fig. 10.8  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"They produce two water waves, and at a particular point, the phase difference between the displacements produced by each of the waves does not change with time.  "
when this happens the two sources are said to be coherent.  
Figure 10.8  -LRB- b -RRB-  shows the position of crests  -LRB- solid circles -RRB-  and troughs  -LRB- dashed circles -RRB-  at a given instant of time.  
I is proportional to a 2.  
"In fact at any point on the perpendicular bisector of S 1 S 2, the intensity will be 4 I.  "
The two sources are said to interfere constructively and we have what is referred to as constructive interference.  
where we have used the fact that a path difference of 2 λ corresponds to a phase difference of 4 π.  
The two displacements are once again in phase and the intensity will again be 4 I 0 giving rise to constructive interference.  
where we have used the fact that a path difference of 2.5 λ corresponds to a phase difference of 5 π.  
The two displacements are now out of phase and the two displacements will cancel out to give zero intensity.  
This is referred to as destructive interference.  
"To summarise: If we have two coherent sources S 1 and S 2 vibrating in phase, then for an arbitrary point P whenever the path difference, we will have constructive interference and the resultant intensity will be 4 I.  "
The sign between S 1 P and S 2 P represents the difference between S 1 P and S 2 P.  
"On the other hand, if the point P is such that the path difference, we will have destructive interference and the resultant intensity will be zero.  "
"Now, for any other arbitrary point G  -LRB- Fig. 10.10 -RRB-  let the phase difference between the two displacements be φ.  "
The amplitude of the resultant displacement is 2 a cos  -LRB- φ / 2 -RRB-  and therefore the intensity at that point will be which corresponds to the condition given by Eq.  -LRB- 10.10 -RRB-   
We will have constructive interference leading to maximum intensity.  
"When this happens, we will observe an average intensity that will be given by where angular brackets represent time averaging.  "
"Indeed it is shown in Section 7.2 that if φ  -LRB- t -RRB-  varies randomly with time, the time-averaged quantity will be 1/2.  "
This is also intuitively obvious because the function cos 2  -LRB- φ / 2 -RRB-  will randomly vary between 0 and 1 and the average value will be 1/2.  
The resultant intensity will be given by  -LRB- 10.14 -RRB-  at all points.  
"When the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes rapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when this happens the intensities just add up.  "
This is indeed what happens when two separate light sources illuminate a wall.  
We will now discuss interference using light waves.  
If we use two sodium lamps illuminating two pinholes  -LRB- Fig. 10.11 -RRB-  we will not observe any interference fringes.  
This is because of the fact that the light wave emitted from an ordinary source  -LRB- like a sodium lamp -RRB-  undergoes abrupt phase changes in times of the order of 10 — 10 seconds.  
Thus the light waves coming out from two independent sources of light will not have any fixed phase relationship and would be incoherent.  
"When this happens, as discussed in the previous section, the intensities on the screen will add up.  "
"The British physicist Thomas Young used an ingenious technique to ""lock "" the phases of the waves emanating from S 1 and S 2.  "
He made two pinholes S 1 and S 2  -LRB- very close to each other -RRB-  on an opaque screen  -LRB- Fig. 10.12  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"These were illuminated by another pinholes that was in turn, lit by a bright source.  "
Light waves spread out from S and fall on both S 1 and S 2.  
"Thus, the two sources S 1 and S 2 will be locked in phase; i.e., they will be coherent like the two vibrating needle in our water wave example  -LRB- Fig. 10.8  -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
"Thus spherical waves emanating from S 1 and S 2 will produce interference fringes on the screen GG ′, as shown in Fig. 10.12  -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
Then negligible error will be introduced if S 2 P + S 1 P  -LRB- in the denominator -RRB-  is replaced by 2 D.  
"In this approximation, Eq.  -LRB- 10.16 -RRB-  becomes Hence we will have constructive interference resulting in a bright region when  "
"On the other hand, we will have a dark region near  "
"Thus dark and bright bands appear on the screen, as shown in Fig. 10.13.  "
Such bands are called fringes.  
Equations  -LRB- 10.18 -RRB-  and  -LRB- 10.19 -RRB-  show that dark and bright fringes are equally spaced and the distance between two consecutive bright and dark fringes is given by which is the expression for the fringe width.  
"Obviously, the central point O  -LRB- in Fig. 10.12 -RRB-  will be bright because and it will correspond to n = 0.  "
In order to determine the shape of the interference pattern on the screen we note that a particular fringe would correspond to the locus of points with a constant value of S 2 P — S 1 P.  
"Whenever this constant is an integral multiple of λ, the fringe will be bright and whenever it is an odd integral multiple of λ / 2 it will be a dark fringe.  "
"Now, the locus of the point P lying in the x - y plane such that is a constant, is a hyperbola.  "
"Thus the fringe pattern will strictly be a hyperbola; however, if the distance D is very large compared to the fringe width, the fringes will be very nearly straight lines as shown in Fig. 10.13.  "
"In the double-slit experiment shown in Fig. 10.12, we have taken the source hole S on the perpendicular bisector of the two slits, which is shown as the line SO.  "
What happens if the source S is slightly away from the perpendicular bisector.  
Consider that the source is moved to some new point S ′ and suppose that Q is the mid-point of S 1 and S 2.  
"If the angle S ′ QS is φ, then the central bright fringe occurs at an angle — φ, on the other side.  "
"Thus, if the source S is on the perpendicular bisector, then the central fringe occurs at O, also on the perpendicular bisector.  "
"This also means that the source S ′, the mid-point Q and the point O ′ of the central fringe are in a straight line.  "
We end this section by quoting from the Nobel lecture of Dennis Gabor  
The wave nature of light was demonstrated convincingly for the first time in 1801 by Thomas Young by a wonderfully simple experiment.  
"He let a ray of sunlight into a dark room, placed a dark screen in front of it, pierced with two small pinholes, and beyond this, at some distance, a white screen.  "
"He then saw two darkish lines at both sides of a bright line, which gave him sufficient encouragement to repeat the experiment,  "
"This time with spirit flame as light source, with a little salt in it to produce the bright yellow sodium light.  "
"This time he saw a number of dark lines, regularly spaced.  "
The first clear proof that light added to light can produce darkness.  
This phenomenon is called interference.  
Thomas Young had expected it because he believed in the wave theory of light.  
We should mention here that the fringes are straight lines although S 1 and S 2 are point sources.  
It seems to turn around corners and enter regions where we would expect a shadow.  
"These effects, known as diffraction, can only be properly understood using wave ideas.  "
"After all, you are hardly surprised to hear sound waves from someone talking around a corner!  "
"When the double slit in Young's experiment is replaced by a single narrow slit  -LRB- illuminated by a monochromatic source -RRB- , a broad pattern with a central bright region is seen.  "
"On both sides, there are alternate dark and bright regions, the intensity becoming weaker away from the center  -LRB- Fig. 10.16 -RRB- .  "
"To understand this, go to Fig. 10.15, which shows a parallel beam of light falling normally on a single slit LN of width a.  "
The diffracted light goes on to meet a screen.  
The midpoint of the slit is M.  
A straight line through M perpendicular to the slit plane meets the screen at C.  
We want the intensity at any point P on the screen.  
"As before, straight lines joining P to the different points L, M, N, etc., can be treated as parallel, making an angle θ with the normal MC.  "
"The basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller parts, and add their contributions at P with the proper phase differences.  "
We are treating different parts of the wavefront at the slit as secondary sources.  
"Because the incoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these sources are in phase.  "
The path difference NP — LP between the two edges of the slit can be calculated exactly as for Young's experiment.  
"We now have to sum up equal, coherent contributions from a large number of sources, each with a different phase.  "
"This calculation was made by Fresnel using integral calculus, so we omit it here.  "
The main features of the diffraction pattern can be understood by simple arguments.  
"At the central point C on the screen, the angle θ is zero.  "
All path differences are zero and  
Hence all the parts of the slit contribute in phase.  
This gives maximum intensity at C.  
"Experimental observation shown in Fig. 10.15 indicates that the intensity has a central maximum at θ = 0 and other secondary maxima at, and has minima  -LRB- zero intensity -RRB-   "
It is easy to see why it has minima at these values of angle.  
"Consider first the angle θ where the path difference a θ is λ.Then,  "
"Now, divide the slit into two equal halves LM and MN each of size a/2.  "
"For every point M 1 in LM, there is a point M 2 in MN such that M 1 M 2 = a/2.  "
The path difference between M 1 and M 2 at for the angle chosen.  
This means that the contributions from M 1 and M 2 are 180º out of phase and cancel in the direction θ = λ / a.  
"Contributions from the two halves of the slit LM and MN, therefore, cancel each other.  "
Equation  -LRB- 10.22 -RRB-  gives the angle at which the intensity falls to zero.  
"One can similarly show that the intensity is zero for θ = n λ / a, with n being any integer  -LRB- except zero! -RRB- .  "
Notice that the angular size of the central maximum increases when the slit width a decreases.  
It is also easy to see why there are maxima at θ =  -LRB- n + 1/2 -RRB-  λ / a and why they go on becoming weaker and weaker with increasing n.  
Consider an angle θ = 3 λ / 2 a which is midway between two of the dark fringes.  
Divide the slit into three equal parts.  
"If we take the first two thirds of the slit, the path difference between the two ends would be  "
The first two-thirds of the slit can therefore be divided into two halves which have a λ / 2 path difference.  
The contributions of these two halves cancel in the same manner as described earlier.  
Only the remaining one-third of the slit contributes to the intensity at a point between the two minima.  
"Clearly, this will be much weaker than the central maximum  -LRB- where the entire slit contributes in phase -RRB- .  "
"One can similarly show that there are maxima at  -LRB- n + 1/2 -RRB-  θ / a with n = 2, 3, etc..  "
"These become weaker with increasing n, since only one-fifth, one-seventh, etc., of the slit contributes in these cases.  "
The photograph and intensity pattern corresponding to it is shown in Fig. 10.16.  
There has been prolonged discussion about difference between intereference and diffraction among scientists since the discovery of these phenomena.  
"In this context, it is interesting to note what Richard Feynman has said in his famous Feynman Lectures on Physics:  "
No one has ever been able to define the difference between interference and diffraction satisfactorily.  
"It is just a question of usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference between them.  "
"In the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the screen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit or hole, and the double-slit interference pattern.  "
This is shown in Fig. 10.17.  
It shows a broader diffraction peak in which there appear several fringes of smaller width due to double-slit interference.  
"The number of interference fringes occuring in the broad diffraction peak depends on the ratio d / a, that is the ratio of the distance between the two slits to the width of a slit.  "
"In the limit of a becoming very small, the diffraction pattern will become very flat and we will obsrve the two-slit interference pattern  -LRB- see Fig. 10.13  -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
"In the double-slit interference experiment of Fig. 10.12, what happens if we close one slit?  "
You will see that it now amounts to a single slit.  
But you will have to take care of some shift in the pattern.  
"We now have a source at S, and only one hole  -LRB- or slit -RRB-  S 1 or S 2.  "
This will produce a single - slit diffraction pattern on the screen.  
"For example, the separation d between the two slits must be of the order of a milimetre or so.  "
"The width a of each slit must be even smaller, of the order of 0.1 or 0.2 mm.  "
"In our discussion of Young's experiment and the single-slit diffraction, we have assumed that the screen on which the fringes are formed is at a large distance.  "
The two or more paths from the slits to the screen were treated as parallel.  
This situation also occurs when we place a converging lens after the slits and place the screen at the focus.  
Parallel paths from the slit are combined at a single point on the screen.  
Note that the lens does not introduce any extra path differences in a parallel beam.  
This arrangement is often used since it gives more intensity than placing the screen far away.  
"If f is the focal length of the lens, then we can easily work out the size of the central bright maximum.  "
"In terms of angles, the separation of the central maximum from the first null of the diffraction pattern is λ / a.  "
"Hence, the size on the screen will be f λ / a.  "
It is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself.  
The equipment needed can be found in most homes — two razor blades and one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament.  
One has to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a narrow slit in between.  
This is easily done with the thumb and forefingers  -LRB- Fig. 10.18 -RRB- .  
"Keep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye.  "
Use spectacles if you normally do.  
"With slight adjustment of the width of the slit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen with its bright and dark bands.  "
"Since the position of all the bands  -LRB- except the central one -RRB-  depends on wavelength, they will show some colors.  "
Using a filter for red or blue will make the fringes clearer.  
"With both filters available, the wider fringes for red compared to blue can be seen.  "
"In this experiment, the filament plays the role of the first slit S in Fig. 10.16.  "
The lens of the eye focuses the pattern on the screen  -LRB- the retina of the eye -RRB- .  
"With some effort, one can cut a double slit in an aluminium foil with a blade.  "
The bulb filament can be viewed as before to repeat Young's experiment.  
"In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending a small angle at the eye.  "
"This is the reflection of the Sun in any shiny convex surface  -LRB- e.g., a cycle bell -RRB- .  "
Do not try direct sunlight — it can damage the eye and will not give fringes anyway as the Sun subtends an angle of  -LRB- 1/2 -RRB- .  
"In interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed.  "
"If it reduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another region, producing a bright fringe.  "
"There is no gain or loss of energy, which is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy.  "
In Chapter 9 we had discussed about telescopes.  
The angular resolution of the telescope is determined by the objective of the telescope.  
The stars which are not resolved in the image produced by the objective can not be resolved by any further magnification produced by the eyepiece.  
The primary purpose of the eyepiece is to provide magnification of the image produced by the objective.  
Consider a parallel beam of light falling on a convex lens.  
"If the lens is well corrected for aberrations, then geometrical optics tells us that the beam will get focused to a point.  "
"However, because of diffraction, the beam instead of getting focused to a point gets focused to a spot of finite area.  "
In this case the effects due to diffraction can be taken into account by considering a plane wave incident on a circular aperture followed by a convex lens  -LRB- Fig. 10.19 -RRB- .  
"The analysis of the corresponding diffraction pattern is quite involved; however, in principle, it is similar to the analysis carried out to obtain the single-slit diffraction pattern.  "
"Taking into account the effects due to diffraction, the pattern on the focal plane would consist of a central bright region surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings  -LRB- Fig. 10.19 -RRB- .  "
A detailed analysis shows that the radius of the central bright region is approximately given by.  
"Where f is the focal length of the lens and 2 a is the diameter of the circular aperture or the diameter of the lens, whichever is smaller.  "
For the two stars to be just resolved will be small if the diameter of the objective is large.  
This implies that the telescope will have better resolving power if a is large.  
"It is for this reason that for better resolution, a telescope must have a large diameter objective.  "
We can apply a similar argument to the objective lens of a microscope.  
"In this case, the object is placed slightly beyond f, so that a real image is formed at a distance v  -LRB- Fig. 10.20 -RRB- .  "
The magnification — ratio of image size to object size — is given by m v / f.  
"When the separation between two points in a microscopic specimen is comparable to the wavelength λ of the light, the diffraction effects become important.  "
The image of a point object will again be a diffraction pattern whose size in the image plane will be  
"Two objects whose images are closer than this distance will not be resolved, they will be seen as one.  "
"The corresponding minimum separation, d, in the object plane is given by.  "
You can estimate the resolving power of your eye with a simple experiment.  
"All the black stripes should be of equal width, while the width of the intermediate white stripes should increase as you go from the left to the right.  "
"For example, let all black stripes have a width of 0.5 mm.  "
Let the width of the first two white stripes be 0.5 mm each.  
"The next two white stripes be 1 mm each, the next two 1.5 mm each, etc..  "
"Paste this pattern on a wall in a room or laboratory, at the height of your eye.  "
"Now watch the pattern, preferably with one eye.  "
"By moving away or closer to the wall, find the position where you can just see some two black stripes as separate stripes.  "
All the black stripes to the left of this stripe would merge into one another and would not be distinguishable.  
"On the other hand, the black stripes to the right of this would be more and more clearly visible.  "
"Note the width d of the white stripe which separates the two regions, and measure the distance D of the wall from your eye.  "
Then d / D is the resolution of your eye.  
You have watched specks of dust floating in air in a sunbeam entering through your window.  
Find the distance  -LRB- of a speck -RRB-  which you can clearly see and distinguish from a neighbouring speck.  
"Knowing the resolution of your eye and the distance of the speck, estimate the size of the speck of dust.  "
The resolving power of the microscope is given by the reciprocal of the minimum separation of two points seen as distinct.  
It can be seen from Eq.  -LRB- 10.30 -RRB-  that the resolving power can be increased by choosing a medium of higher refractive index.  
Usually an oil having a refractive index close to that of the objective glass is used.  
Such an arrangement is called an oil immersion objective.  
Notice that it is not possible to make sin β larger than unity.  
"Thus, we see that the resolving power of a microscope is basically determined by the wavelength of the light used.  "
"There is a likehood of confusion between resolution and magnification, and similarly between the role of a telescope and a microscope to deal with these parameters.  "
A telescope produces images of far objects nearer to our eye.  
"Therefore objects which are not resolved at far distance, can be resolved by looking at them through a telescope.  "
"A microscope, on the other hand, magnifies objects  -LRB- which are near to us -RRB-  and produces their larger image.  "
"We may be looking at two stars or two satellites of a far-away planet, or we may be looking at different regions of a living cell.  "
"In this context, it is good to remember that a telescope resolves whereas a microscope magnifies.  "
"An aperture  -LRB- i.e., slit or hole -RRB-  of size a illuminated by a parallel beam sends diffracted light into an angle of approximately.  "
This is the angular size of the bright central maximum.  
"In traveling a distance z, the diffracted beam therefore acquires a width z λ / a due to diffraction.  "
It is interesting to ask at what value of z the spreading due to diffraction becomes comparable to the size a of the aperture.  
We thus approximately equate z λ / a with a.  
This gives the distance beyond which divergence of the beam of width a becomes significant.  
"Therefore, We define a quantity z called the Fresnel distance.  "
"Shows that for distances much smaller than z, the spreading due to diffraction is smaller compared to the size of the beam.  "
It becomes comparable when the distance is approximately z.  
"For distances much greater than z, the spreading due to diffraction dominates over that due to ray optics  -LRB- i.e., the size a of the aperture -RRB- .  "
Equation  -LRB- 10.31 -RRB-  also shows that ray optics is valid in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.  
"Consider holding a long string that is held horizontally, the other end of which is assumed to be fixed.  "
"If we move the end of the string up and down in a periodic manner, we will generate a wave propagating in the direction  -LRB- Fig. 10.22 -RRB- .  "
Such a wave could be described by the following equation  
"Further, represents the wavelength associated with the wave.  "
We had discussed propagation of such waves in Chapter 15 of Class XI textbook.  
"Since the displacement  -LRB- which is along the y direction -RRB-  is at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave, we have what is known as a transverse wave.  "
"Also, since the displacement is in the y direction, it is often referred to as a y-polarised wave.  "
The electric vectors  -LRB- associated with the propagating light wave -RRB-  along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed.  
"Thus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then the light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating along a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules.  "
This direction is known as the pass-axis of the polaroid  
"Thus, if the light from an ordinary source  -LRB- like a sodium lamp -RRB-  passes through a polaroid sheet P 1, it is observed that its intensity is reduced by half.  "
Rotating P 1 has no effect on the transmitted beam and transmitted intensity remains constant.  
"Now, let an identical piece of polaroid P 2 be placed before P 1.  "
"As expected, the light from the lamp is reduced in intensity on passing through P 2 alone.  "
But now rotating P 1 has a dramatic effect on the light coming from P 2.  
"In one position, the intensity transmitted by P 2 followed by P 1 is nearly zero.  "
"When turned by 90º from this position, P 1 transmits nearly the full intensity emerging from P 2  -LRB- Fig. 10.22 -RRB- .  "
The above experiment can be easily understood by assuming that light passing through the polaroid P 2 gets polarised along the pass-axis of P 2.  
"Thus, as we rotate the polaroid P 1  -LRB- or P 2 -RRB- , the intensity will vary as: where is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through P 1.  "
This is known as Malus' law.  
The above discussion shows that the intensity coming out of a single polaroid is half of the incident intensity.  
"By putting a second polaroid, the intensity can be further controlled from 50 % to zero of the incident intensity by adjusting the angle between the pass-axes of two polaroids.  "
"Polaroids can be used to control the intensity, in sunglasses, windowpanes, etc..  "
Polaroids are also used in photographic cameras and 3D movie cameras.  
The light from a clear blue portion of the sky shows a rise and fall of intensity when viewed through a polaroid which is rotated.  
"This is nothing but sunlight, which has changed its direction  -LRB- having been scattered -RRB-  on encountering the molecules of the earth's atmosphere.  "
"As Fig. 10.24  -LRB- a -RRB-  shows, the incident sunlight is unpolarised.  "
The dots stand for polarisation perpendicular to the plane of the figure.  
The double arrows show polarisation in the plane of the figure.  
 -LRB- There is no phase relation between these two in unpolarised light -RRB- .  
Under the influence of the electric field of the incident wave the electrons in the molecules acquire components of motion in both these directions.  
We have drawn an observer looking at 90° to the direction of the sun.  
"Clearly, charges accelerating parallel to the double arrows do not radiate energy towards this observer since their acceleration has no transverse component.  "
The radiation scattered by the molecule is therefore represented by dots.  
It is polarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure.  
This explains the polarisation of scattered light from the sky.  
The scattering of light by molecules was intensively investigated by C.V. Raman and his collaborators in Kolkata in the 1920.  
Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for this work.  
We have drawn a situation in which the reflected wave travels at right angles to the refracted wave.  
The oscillating electrons in the water produce the reflected wave.  
"These move in the two directions transverse to the radiation from wave in the medium, i.e., the refracted wave.  "
The arrows are parallel to the direction of the reflected wave.  
Motion in this direction does not contribute to the reflected wave.  
"As the figure shows, the reflected light is therefore linearly polarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure  -LRB- represented by dots -RRB- .  "
This can be checked by looking at the reflected light through an analyser.  
"The transmitted intensity will be zero when the axis of the analyser is in the plane of the figure, i.e., the plane of incidence.  "
"Thus we have seen that when reflected wave is perpendicular to the refracted wave, the reflected wave is a totally polarised wave.  "
The angle of incidence in this case is called Brewster's angle and is denoted by i B.  
We can see that i B is related to the refractive index of the denser medium.  
"For simplicity, we have discussed scattering of light by 90º, and reflection at the Brewster angle.  "
"In this special situation, one of the two perpendicular components of the electric field is zero.  "
"At other angles, both components are present but one is stronger than the other.  "
There is no stable phase relationship between the two perpendicular components since these are derived from two perpendicular components of an unpolarised beam.  
"When such light is viewed through a rotating analyser, one sees a maximum and a minimum of intensity but not complete darkness.  "
This kind of light is called partially polarised.  
Let us try to understand the situation.  
"When an unpolarised beam of light is incident at the Brewster's angle on an interface of two media, only part of light with electric field vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence will be reflected.  "
We began this chapter by pointing out that there are some phenomena which can be explained only by the wave theory.  
Then we described Young's double slit experiment which was a turning point in the study of optics.  
"Finally, we described some associated points such as diffraction, resolution, polarisation, and validity of ray optics.  "
"In the next chapter, you will see how new experiments led to new theories at the turn of the century around 1900 A.D.  "
The Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and Hertz experiments on the generation and detection of electromagnetic waves in 1887 strongly established the wave nature of light.  
"Towards the same period at the end of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity  -LRB- electric discharge -RRB-  through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led to many historic discoveries.  "
"The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895, and of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in the understanding of atomic structure.  "
"It was found that at sufficiently low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took place between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas in the discharge tube.  "
A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite to cathode.  
"The color of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass, it being yellowish-green for soda glass.  "
The cause of this fluorescence was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the cathode.  
"These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams of fast moving negatively charged particles.  "
The British physicist J. J. Thomson  -LRB- 1856 -1940 -RRB-  confirmed this hypothesis.  
"Further, the value of e / m was found to be independent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode  -LRB- emitter -RRB- , or the gas introduced in the discharge tube.  "
This observation suggested the universality of the cathode ray particles.  
"Around the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when irradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having small speeds.  "
"Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were found to emit negatively charged particles.  "
The value of e / m of these particles was found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles.  
"These observations thus established that all these particles, although produced under different conditions, were identical in nature.  "
"J. J. Thomson, in 1897, named these particles as electrons, and suggested that they were fundamental, universal constituents of matter.  "
"For his epoch-making discovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental investigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906.  "
"In 1913, the American physicist R. A. Millikan  -LRB- 1868 -1953 -RRB-  performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for the precise measurement of the charge on an electron.  "
"He found that the charge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary charge, 1.602 × 10 — 19 C.  "
Millikan's experiment established that electric charge is quantised.  
"From the values of charge  -LRB- e -RRB-  and specific charge  -LRB- e / m -RRB- , the mass  -LRB- m -RRB-  of the electron could be determined.  "
We know that metals have free electrons  -LRB- negatively charged particles -RRB-  that are responsible for their conductivity.  
"However, the free electrons can not normally escape out of the metal surface.  "
"If an electron attempts to come out of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge and pulls the electron back to the metal.  "
The free electron is thus held inside the metal surface by the attractive forces of the ions.  
"Consequently, the electron can come out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome the attractive pull.  "
A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be given to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal.  
This minimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface is called the work function of the metal.  
"One electron volt is the energy gained by an electron when it has been accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt,  "
This unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics.  
The values of work function of some metals are given in Table 11.1.  
These values are approximate as they are very sensitive to surface impurities.  
" -LRB- i -RRB-  Thermionic emission: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy can be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the metal.  "
" -LRB- iii -RRB-  Photo-electric emission: When light of suitable frequency illuminates a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface.  "
These photo  -LRB- light -RRB-  - generated electrons are called photoelectrons.  
"The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz  -LRB- 1857-1894 -RRB- , during his electromagnetic wave experiments.  "
"Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of free, charged particles which we now know as electrons.  "
"When light falls on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions in the material of the surface.  "
"After gaining sufficient energy from the incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the surrounding space.  "
Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of photoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902.  
"As soon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also Metal Work function stopped.  "
"These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall on the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted towards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field.  "
"The electrons flow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow.  "
"Thus, light falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external circuit.  "
"Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with collector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light.  "
"Hallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a negatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope.  "
He observed that the zinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light.  
"Further, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was irradiated by ultraviolet light.  "
Positive charge on a positively charged zinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light.  
From these observations he concluded that negatively charged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of ultraviolet light.  
"After the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the incident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate.  "
"Due to negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector plate by the electric field.  "
"Hallwachs and Lenard also observed that when ultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all when the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain minimum value, called the threshold frequency.  "
This minimum frequency depends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate.  
"It was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc., responded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause electron emission from the surface.  "
"However, some alkali metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive even to visible light.  "
All these photosensitive substances emit electrons when they are illuminated by light.  
"After the discovery of electrons, these electrons were termed as photoelectrons.  "
The phenomenon is called photoelectric effect.  
Figure 11.1 depicts a schematic view of the arrangement used for the experimental study of the photoelectric effect.  
It consists of an evacuated glass/quartz tube having a photosensitive plate C and another metal plate A.  
Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short wavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive plate C  -LRB- emitter -RRB- .  
"A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass tube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate the photosensitive plate C.  "
"The electrons are emitted by the plate C and are collected by the plate A  -LRB- collector -RRB- , by the electric field created by the battery.  "
"The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates C and A, that can be varied.  "
The polarity of the plates C and A can be reversed by a commutator.  
"Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired positive or negative potential with respect to emitter C.  "
"When the collector plate A is positive with respect to the emitter plate C, the electrons are attracted to it.  "
The emission of electrons causes flow of electric current in the circuit.  
The potential difference between the emitter and collector plates is measured by a voltmeter  -LRB- V -RRB-  whereas the resulting photo current flowing in the circuit is measured by a microammeter  -LRB- μA -RRB- .  
The photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the potential of collector plate A with respect to the emitter plate C.  
"The intensity and frequency of the incident light can be varied, as can the potential difference V between the emitter C and the collector A.  "
" -LRB- a -RRB-  Intensity of radiation,  "
" -LRB- b -RRB-  Frequency of incident radiation,  "
 -LRB- c -RRB-  The potential difference between the plates A and C.  
 -LRB- d -RRB-  The nature of the material of plate C.  
Light of different frequencies can be used by putting appropriate colored filter or colored glass in the path of light falling on the emitter C.  
The intensity of light is varied by changing the distance of the light source from the emitter.  
The collector A is maintained at a positive potential with respect to emitter C so that electrons ejected from C are attracted towards collector A.  
"Keeping the frequency of the incident radiation and the accelerating potential fixed, the intensity of light is varied and the resulting photoelectric current is measured each time.  "
It is found that the photocurrent increases linearly with intensity of incident light as shown graphically in Fig. 11.2.  
The photocurrent is directly proportional to the number of photoelectrons emitted per second.  
This implies that the number of photoelectrons emitted per second is directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiation.  
We first keep the plate A at some positive accelerating potential with respect to the plate C and illuminate the plate C with light of fixed frequency ν and fixed intensity I 1.  
We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and measure the resulting photocurrent each time.  
It is found that the photoelectric current increases with increase in accelerating  -LRB- positive -RRB-  potential.  
"If we increase the accelerating potential of plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase.  "
This maximum value of the photoelectric current is called saturation current.  
Saturation current corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by the emitter plate C reach the collector plate A.  
We now apply a negative  -LRB- retarding -RRB-  potential to the plate A with respect to the plate C and make it increasingly negative gradually.  
"When the polarity is reversed, the electrons are repelled and only the most energetic electrons are able to reach the collector A.  "
"The photocurrent is found to decrease rapidly until it drops to zero at a certain sharply defined, critical value of the negative potential V 0 on the plate A.  "
The interpretation of the observation in terms of photoelectrons is straightforward.  
All the photoelectrons emitted from the metal do not have the same energy.  
"Photoelectric current is zero when the stopping potential is sufficient to repel even the most energetic photoelectrons, with the maximum kinetic energy  -LRB- K max -RRB- ,  "
We note that the saturation currents are now found to be at higher values.  
"This shows that more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the intensity of incident radiation.  "
"But the stopping potential remains the same as that for the incident radiation of intensity I 1, as shown graphically in Fig. 11.3.  "
"Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the stopping potential is independent of its intensity.  "
"In other words, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source and the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident radiation.  "
We now study the relation between the frequency ν of the incident radiation and the stopping potential V 0.  
We suitably adjust the same intensity of light radiation at various frequencies and study the variation of photocurrent with collector plate potential.  
The resulting variation is shown in Fig. 11.4.  
We obtain different values of stopping potential but the same value of the saturation current for incident radiation of different frequencies.  
The energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the incident radiations.  
The stopping potential is more negative for higher frequencies of incident radiation.  
"This implies that greater the frequency of incident light, greater is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons.  "
"Consequently, we need greater retarding potential to stop them completely.  "
"If we plot a graph between the frequency of incident radiation and the corresponding stopping potential for different metals we get a straight line, as shown in Fig. 11.5.  "
The graph shows that  -LRB- i -RRB-  the stopping potential V 0 varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation for a given photosensitive material.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency ν 0 for which the stopping potential is zero.  
"These observations have two implications:  -LRB- i -RRB-  The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity.  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  For a frequency ν of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off frequency ν, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the intensity is large.  "
"This minimum, cut-off frequency ν 0, is called the threshold frequency.  "
It is different for different metals.  
Different photosensitive materials respond differently to light.  
Selenium is more sensitive than zinc or copper.  
The same photosensitive substance gives different response to light of different wavelengths.  
"For example, ultraviolet light gives rise to photoelectric effect in copper while green or red light does not.  "
It is now known that emission starts in a time of the order of 10 — 9 s or less.  
We now summarise the experimental features and observations described in this section.  
"Above the threshold frequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity  -LRB- Fig. 11.5 -RRB- .  "
The wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth century.  
"Further, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of energy by electron takes place continuously over the entire wavefront of the radiation.  "
"Since a large number of electrons absorb energy, the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small.  "
This conclusion is again in striking contrast to observation  -LRB- iv -RRB-  that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous.  
"In short, the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of photoelectric emission.  "
"In 1905, Albert Einstein  -LRB- 1879 -1955 -RRB-  proposed a radically new picture of electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect.  "
"In this picture, photoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of energy from radiation.  "
Radiation energy is built up of discrete units — the so called quanta of energy of radiation.  
"Each quantum of radiant energy has energy h ν, where h is Planck's constant and ν the frequency of light.  "
"In photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy  -LRB- h ν -RRB-  of radiation.  "
Note that the intensity of light of a given frequency is determined by the number of photons incident per second.  
Increasing the intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons per second.  
"However, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each photon.  "
Equation  -LRB- 11.2 -RRB-  is known as Einstein's photoelectric equation.  
We now see how this equation accounts in a simple and elegant manner all the observations on photoelectric effect given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3.  
"According to Eq.  -LRB- 11.2 -RRB- , K max depends linearly on ν, and is independent of intensity of radiation, in agreement with observation.  "
"This has happened because in Einstein's picture, photoelectric effect arises from the absorption of a single quantum of radiation by a single electron.  "
The intensity of radiation  -LRB- that is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time -RRB-  is irrelevant to this basic process.  
"In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above, is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time.  "
"This explains why, for ν  _GREAT_GT;  ν 0, photoelectric current is proportional to intensity.  "
"In Einstein's picture, the basic elementary process involved in photoelectric effect is the absorption of a light quantum by an electron.  "
This process is instantaneous.  
"Thus, whatever may be the intensity i.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area per unit time, photoelectric emission is instantaneous.  "
"Low intensity does not mean delay in emission, since the basic elementary process is the same.  "
"It predicts that the V 0 versus ν curve is a straight line with slope =  -LRB- h / e -RRB- , independent of the nature of the material.  "
"During 1906-1916, Millikan performed a series of experiments on photoelectric effect, aimed at disproving Einstein's photoelectric equation.  "
"He measured the slope of the straight line obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig. 11.5.  "
"Using the known value of e, he determined the value of Planck's constant h.  "
"In 1923, Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.  "
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  Each photon has energy E and momentum p , and speed c, the speed of light.  "
" -LRB- iii -RRB-  All photons of light of a particular frequency ν, or wavelength λ, have the same energy E and momentum p , whatever the intensity of radiation may be.  "
"By increasing the intensity of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having the same energy.  "
"Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of radiation.  "
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Photons are electrically neutral and are not deflected by electric and magnetic fields.  
" -LRB- v -RRB-  In a photon-particle collision  -LRB- such as photon-electron collision -RRB- , the total energy and total momentum are conserved.  "
"However, the number of photons may not be conserved in a collision.  "
The photon may be absorbed or a new photon may be created.  
"The dual  -LRB- wave-particle -RRB-  nature of light  -LRB- electromagnetic radiation, in general -RRB-  comes out clearly from what we have learned in this and the preceding chapters.  "
"The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation.  "
"On the other hand, in photoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve energy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it is made up of a bunch of particles — the photons.  "
Whether a particle or wave description is best suited for understanding an experiment depends on the nature of the experiment.  
"For example, in the familiar phenomenon of seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are important.  "
The gathering and focussing mechanism of light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture.  
But its absorption by the rods and cones  -LRB- of the retina -RRB-  requires the photon picture of light.  
"A natural question arises: If radiation has a dual  -LRB- wave-particle -RRB-  nature, might not the particles of nature  -LRB- the electrons, protons, etc. -RRB-  also exhibit wave-like character?  "
"He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the two basic physical entities — matter and energy, must have symmetrical character.  "
"If radiation shows dual aspects, so should matter.  "
De Broglie proposed that the wave length λ associated with a particle of momentum p is given as λ where m is the mass of the particle and v its speed.  
Equation  -LRB- 11.5 -RRB-  is known as the de Broglie relation and the wavelength λ of the matter wave is called de Broglie wavelength.  
The dual aspect of matter is evident in the de Broglie relation.  
"On the left hand side of Eq.  -LRB- 11.5 -RRB- , λ is the attribute of a wave while on the right hand side the momentum p is a typical attribute of a particle.  "
Planck's constant h relates the two attributes.  
Equation  -LRB- 11.5 -RRB-  for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose validity can be tested only by experiment.  
"However, it is interesting to see that it is satisfied also by a photon.  "
"Clearly, from Eq.  -LRB- 11.5 -RRB- , λ is smaller for a heavier particle  -LRB- large m -RRB-  or more energetic particle  -LRB- large v -RRB- .  "
"For example, the de Broglie wavelength of a ball of mass 0.12 kg moving with a speed of 20 m s — 1 is easily calculated:  "
A photocell is a technological application of the photoelectric effect.  
It is a device whose electrical properties are affected by light.  
It is also sometimes called an electric eye.  
It is connected to the external circuit having a high-tension battery B and microammeter  -LRB- μA -RRB-  as shown in the Figure.  
"Sometimes, instead of the plate C, a thin layer of photosensitive material is pasted on the inside of the bulb.  "
A part of the bulb is left clean for the light to enter it.  
"When light of suitable wavelength falls on the emitter C, photoelectrons are emitted.  "
These photoelectrons are drawn to the collector A.  
Photocurrent of the order of a few microampere can be normally obtained from a photo cell.  
A photocell converts a change in intensity of illumination into a change in photocurrent.  
This current can be used to operate control systems and in light measuring devices.  
A photocell of lead sulphide sensitive to infrared radiation is used in electronic ignition circuits.  
"In scientific work, photo cells are used whenever it is necessary to measure the intensity of light.  "
Light meters in photographic cameras make use of photo cells to measure the intensity of incident light.  
"The photocells, inserted in the door light electric circuit, are used as automatic door opener.  "
A person approaching a doorway may interrupt a light beam which is incident on a photocell.  
The abrupt change in photocurrent may be used to start a motor which opens the door or rings an alarm.  
"So photocells help count the persons entering an auditorium, provided they enter the hall one by one.  "
They are used for detection of traffic law defaulters.  
An alarm may be sounded whenever a beam of  -LRB- invisible -RRB-  radiation is intercepted.  
"In burglar alarm,  -LRB- invisible -RRB-  ultraviolet light is continuously made to fall on a photocell installed at the doorway.  "
A person entering the door interrupts the beam falling on the photocell.  
The abrupt change in photocurrent is used to start an electric bell ringing.  
"In fire alarm, a number of photocells are installed at suitable places in a building.  "
"In the event of breaking out of fire, light radiations fall upon the photocell.  "
This completes the electric circuit through an electric bell or a siren which starts operating as a warning signal.  
Photocells are used in the reproduction of sound in motion pictures and in the television camera for scanning and telecasting scenes.  
They are used in industries for detecting minor flaws or holes in metal sheets.  
This wavelength is so small that it is beyond any measurement.  
This is the reason why macroscopic objects in our daily life do not show wave-like properties.  
"On the other hand, in the sub-atomic domain, the wave character of particles is significant and measurable.  "
"Consider an electron  -LRB- mass m, charge e -RRB-  accelerated from rest through a potential V.  "
"For a 120 V accelerating potential, Eq.  -LRB- 11.11 -RRB-  gives λ = 0.112 nm.  "
This wavelength is of the same order as the spacing between the atomic planes in crystals.  
This suggests that matter waves associated with an electron could be verified by crystal diffraction experiments analogous to X-ray diffraction.  
We describe the experimental verification of the de Broglie hypothesis in the next section.  
"In 1929, de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.  "
The matter — wave picture elegantly incorporated the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.  
"According to the principle, it is not possible to measure both the position and momentum of an electron  -LRB- or any other particle -RRB-  at the same time exactly.  "
A wave of definite  -LRB- single -RRB-  wavelength extends all over space.  
By Born's probability interpretation this means that the electron is not localized in any finite region of space.  
"In general, the matter wave associated with the electron is not extended all over space.  "
It is a wave packet extending over some finite region of space.  
In that case Δ x is not infinite but has some finite value depending on the extension of the wave packet.  
"Also, you must appreciate that a wave packet of finite extension does not have a single wavelength.  "
It is built up of wavelengths spread around some central wavelength.  
"By de Broglie's relation, then, the momentum of the electron will also have a spread — an uncertainty Δ p.  "
This is as expected from the uncertainty principle.  
Probability density means probability per unit volume.  
"Thus, if the intensity of matter wave is large in a certain region, there is a greater probability of the particle being found there than where the intensity is small.  "
"The wave nature of electrons was first experimentally verified by C.J. Davisson and L.H. Germer in 1927 and independently by G.P. Thomson, in 1928,  "
Who observed diffraction effects with beams of electrons scattered by crystals.  
Davisson and Thomson shared the Nobel Prize in 1937 for their experimental discovery of diffraction of electrons by crystals.  
The experimental arrange - ment used by Davisson and Germer is schematically shown in Fig. 11.7.  
"It consists of an electron gun which comprises of a tungsten filament F, coated with barium oxide and heated by a low voltage power supply  -LRB- L.T. or battery -RRB- .  "
Electrons emitted by the filament are accelerated to a desired velocity by applying suitable potential/voltage from a high voltage power supply  -LRB- H.T. or battery -RRB- .  
"They are made to pass through a cylinder with fine holes along its axis, producing a fine collimated beam.  "
The beam is made to fall on the surface of a nickel crystal.  
The electrons are scattered in all directions by the atoms of the crystal.  
"The intensity of the electron beam, scattered in a given direction, is measured by the electron detector  -LRB- collector -RRB- .  "
"The detector can be moved on a circular scale and is connected to a sensitive galvanometer, which records the current.  "
The deflection of the galvanometer is proportional to the intensity of the electron beam entering the collector.  
The apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated chamber.  
The variation of the intensity  -LRB- I -RRB-  of the scattered electrons with the angle of scattering θ is obtained for different accelerating voltages.  
The experiment was performed by varying the accelarating voltage from 44 V to 68 V.  
It was noticed that a strong peak appeared in the intensity  -LRB- I -RRB-  of the scattered electron for an accelarating voltage of 54V at a scattering angle θ = 50º  
The appearance of the peak in a particular direction is due to the constructive interference of electrons scattered from different layers of the regularly spaced atoms of the crystals.  
"From the electron diffraction measurements, the wavelength of matter waves was found to be 0.165 nm.  "
"The de Broglie wavelength λ associated with electrons, using Eq.  -LRB- 11.11 -RRB- , for V = 54 V is given by .  "
"Thus, there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical value and the experimentally obtained value of de Broglie wavelength.  "
Davisson - Germer experiment thus strikingly confirms the wave nature of electrons and the de Broglie relation.  
"More recently, in 1989, the wave nature of a beam of electrons was experimentally demonstrated in a double-slit experiment, similar to that used for the wave nature of light.  "
"Also, in an experiment in 1994, interference fringes were obtained with the beams of iodine molecules, which are about a million times more massive than electrons.  "
The de Broglie hypothesis has been basic to the development of modern quantum mechanics.  
It has also led to the field of electron optics.  
"The wave properties of electrons have been utilised in the design of electron microscope which is a great improvement, with higher resolution, over the optical microscope.  "
"By the nineteenth century, enough evidence had accumulated in favor of atomic hypothesis of matter.  "
"However, atoms on a whole are electrically neutral.  "
"Therefore, an atom must also contain some positive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons.  "
But what is the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom?  
"In other words, what is the structure of an atom?  "
The first model of atom was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898.  
"According to this model, the positive charge of the atom is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged electrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon.  "
This model was picturesquely called plum pudding model of the atom.  
"However subsequent studies on atoms, as described in this chapter, showed that the distribution of the electrons and positive charges are very different from that proposed in this model.  "
"We know that condensed matter  -LRB- solids and liquids -RRB-  and dense gases at all temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation in which a continuous distribution of several wavelengths is present, though with different intensities.  "
"This radiation is considered to be due to oscillations of atoms and molecules, governed by the interaction of each atom or molecule with its neighbors.  "
"In contrast, light emitted from rarefied gases heated in a flame, or excited electrically in a glow tube such as the familiar neon sign or mercury vapor light has only certain discrete wavelengths.  "
The spectrum appears as a series of bright lines.  
The details are discussed in Section 12.2.  
The explanation of the results led to the birth of Rutherford's planetary model of atom  -LRB- also called the nuclear model of the atom -RRB- .  
Rutherford's nuclear model was a major step towards how we see the atom today.  
"However, it could not explain why atoms emit light of only discrete wavelengths.  "
"How could an atom as simple as hydrogen, consisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex spectrum of specific wavelengths?  "
"In the classical picture of an atom, the electron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves round the sun.  "
"However, we shall see that there are some serious difficulties in accepting such a model.  "
"At the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 1911, H. Geiger and E. Marsden performed some experiments.  "
"In one of their experiments, as shown in Fig. 12.1, they directed a beam of 5.5 MeV α-particles emitted from a Bi radioactive source at a thin metal foil made of gold.  "
Figure 12.2 shows a schematic diagram of this experiment.  
Alpha-particles emitted by a Bi radioactive source were collimated into a narrow beam by their passage through lead bricks.  
The beam was allowed to fall on a thin foil of gold of thickness 2.1 × 10 m.  
The scattered alpha-particles were observed through a rotatable detector consisting of zinc sulphide screen and a microscope.  
The scattered alpha-particles on striking the screen produced brief light flashes or scintillations.  
These flashes may be viewed through a microscope and the distribution of the number of scattered particles may be studied as a function of angle of scattering.  
"A typical graph of the total number of α-particles scattered at different angles, in a given interval of time, is shown in Fig. 12.3.  "
"The dots in this figure represent the data points and the solid curve is the theoretical prediction based on the assumption that the target atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.  "
Many of the α-particles pass through the foil.  
It means that they do not suffer any collisions.  
Only about 0.14 % of the incident α-particles scatter by more than 1º; and about 1 in 8000 deflect by more than 90º.  
"Rutherford argued that, to deflect the α-particle backwards, it must experience a large repulsive force.  "
This force could be provided if the greater part of the mass of the atom and its positive charge were concentrated tightly at its center.  
"Then the incoming α-particle could get very close to the positive charge without penetrating it, and such a close encounter would result in a large deflection.  "
This agreement supported the hypothesis of the nuclear atom.  
This is why Rutherford is credited with the discovery of the nucleus.  
"In Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom, the entire positive charge and most of the mass of the atom are concentrated in the nucleus with the electrons some distance away.  "
The electrons would be moving in orbits about the nucleus just as the planets do around the sun.  
Rutherford's experiments suggested the size of the nucleus to be about 10 m to 10 m.  
"Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a distance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of the nucleus itself.  "
"Thus, most of an atom is empty space.  "
"With the atom being largely empty space, it is easy to see why most α-particles go right through a thin metal foil.  "
"However, when α-particle happens to come near a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large angle.  "
"The atomic electrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the α-particles.  "
The scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analyzed by employing Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom.  
"As the gold foil is very thin, it can be assumed that α-particles will suffer not more than one scattering during their passage through it.  "
"Therefore, computation of the trajectory of an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough.  "
"Alpha - particles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2 e, of positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom.  "
"The charge of the gold nucleus is Z e, where Z is the atomic number of the atom; for gold Z = 79.  "
"Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an α-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary throughout the scattering process.  "
The magnitude of this force is  
where r is the distance between the α-particle and the nucleus.  
The force is directed along the line joining the α-particle and the nucleus.  
The magnitude and direction of the force on an α-particle continuously changes as it approaches the nucleus and recedes away from it.  
"The trajectory traced by an α-particle depends on the impact parameter, b of collision.  "
The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance of the initial velocity vector of the α-particle from the center of the nucleus  -LRB- Fig. 12.4 -RRB- .  
"A given beam of α-particles has a distribution of impact parameters b, so that the beam is scattered in various directions with different probabilities  -LRB- Fig. 12.4 -RRB- .  "
" -LRB- In a beam, all particles have nearly same kinetic energy. -RRB-   "
It is seen that an α-particle close to the nucleus  -LRB- small impact parameter -RRB-  suffers large scattering.  
"In case of head-on collision, the impact parameter is minimum and the α-particle rebounds back  -LRB- θ ≅ π -RRB- .  "
"For a large impact parameter, the α-particle goes nearly undeviated and has a small deflection  -LRB- θ ≅ 0 -RRB- .  "
The fact that only a small fraction of the number of incident particles rebound back indicates that the number of α-particles undergoing head on collision is small.  
"This, in turn, implies that the mass of the atom is concentrated in a small volume.  "
"Rutherford scattering therefore, is a powerful way to determine an upper limit to the size of the nucleus.  "
"The electrostatic force of attraction, F e between the revolving electrons and the nucleus provides the requisite centripetal force  -LRB- F c -RRB-  to keep them in their orbits.  "
"Thus, for a dynamically stable orbit in a hydrogen atom  "
Thus the relation between the orbit radius and the electron velocity is  
The kinetic energy  -LRB- K -RRB-  and electrostatic potential energy  -LRB- U -RRB-  of the electron in hydrogen atom are  
 -LRB- The negative sign in U signifies that the electrostatic force is in the — r direction -RRB- .  
Thus the total energy E of the electron in a hydrogen atom is  
The total energy of the electron is negative.  
This implies the fact that the electron is bound to the nucleus.  
"If E were positive, an electron will not follow a closed orbit around the nucleus.  "
"As mentioned in Section 12.1, each element has a characteristic spectrum of radiation, which it emits.  "
"When an atomic gas or vapor is excited at low pressure, usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum which contains certain specific wavelengths only.  "
A spectrum of this kind is termed as emission line spectrum and it consists of bright lines on a dark background.  
The spectrum emitted by atomic hydrogen is shown in Fig. 12.5.  
"Study of emission line spectra of a material can therefore serve as a type of ""fingerprint "" for identification of the gas.  "
When white light passes through a gas and we analyze the transmitted light using a spectrometer we find some dark lines in the spectrum.  
These dark lines correspond precisely to those wavelengths which were found in the emission line spectrum of the gas.  
This is called the absorption spectrum of the material of the gas.  
We might expect that the frequencies of the light emitted by a particular element would exhibit some regular pattern.  
"Hydrogen is the simplest atom and therefore, has the simplest spectrum.  "
"In the observed spectrum, however, at first sight, there does not seem to be any resemblance of order or regularity in spectral lines.  "
But the spacing between lines within certain sets of the hydrogen spectrum decreases in a regular way  -LRB- Fig. 12.5 -RRB- .  
Each of these sets is called a spectral series.  
"In 1885, the first such series was observed by a Swedish school teacher Johann Jakob Balmer  -LRB- 1825 — 1898 -RRB-  in the visible region of the hydrogen spectrum.  "
This series is called Balmer series  -LRB- Fig. 12.6 -RRB- .  
"As the wavelength decreases, the lines appear closer together and are weaker in intensity.  "
Balmer found a simple empirical formula for the observed wavelengths  
"where λ is the wavelength, R is a constant called the Rydberg constant, and n may have integral values 3, 4, 5, etc..  "
The value of R is 1.097 × 10 7 m -1.  
This equation is also called Balmer formula.  
"Taking n = 3 in Eq.  -LRB- 12.5 -RRB- , one obtains the wavelength of the H α line:  "
"For n = 4, one obtains the wavelength of H β line, etc..  "
"For n = ∞, one obtains the limit of the series, at λ = 364.6 nm.  "
This is the shortest wavelength in the Balmer series.  
"Beyond this limit, no further distinct lines appear, instead only a faint continuous spectrum is seen.  "
"Other series of spectra for hydrogen were subsequently discovered ; These are known, after their discoverers, as Lyman, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund series.  "
"According to classical electromagnetic theory, an accelerating charged particle emits radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves.  "
"The energy of an accelerating electron should therefore, continuously decrease.  "
The electron would spiral inward and eventually fall into the nucleus  -LRB- Fig. 12.7 -RRB- .  
"Thus, such an atom can not be stable.  "
"Further, according to the classical electromagnetic theory, the frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of revolution.  "
"As the electrons spiral inwards, their angular velocities and hence their frequencies would change continuously, and so will the frequency of the light emitted.  "
"Thus, they would emit a continuous spectrum, in contradiction to the line spectrum actually observed.  "
Clearly Rutherford model tells only a part of the story implying that the classical ideas are not sufficient to explain the atomic structure.  
It was Niels Bohr  -LRB- 1885 — 1962 -RRB-  who made certain modifications in this model by adding the ideas of the newly developing quantum hypothesis.  
Niels Bohr studied in Rutherford's laboratory for several months in 1912 and he was convinced about the validity of Rutherford nuclear model.  
"Faced with the dilemma as discussed above, Bohr, in 1913, concluded that in spite of the success of electromagnetic theory in explaining large-scale phenomena, it could not be applied to the processes at the atomic scale.  "
It became clear that a fairly radical departure from the established principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism would be needed to understand the structure of atoms and the relation of atomic structure to atomic spectra.  
Bohr combined classical and early quantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates.  
" -LRB- i -RRB-  Bohr's first postulate was that an electron in an atom could revolve in certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy,  "
contrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory.  
"According to this postulate, each atom has certain definite stable states in which it can exist, and each possible state has definite total energy.  "
These are called the stationary states of the atom.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Bohr's second postulate defines these stable orbits.  
This postulate states that the electron revolves around the nucleus only in those orbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of h/2 π  
where h is the Planck's constant  -LRB- = 6.6 × 10 -34 J s -RRB- .  
Thus the angular momentum  -LRB- L -RRB-  of the orbiting electron is quantised.  
That is  -LRB- iii -RRB-  Bohr's third postulate incorporated into atomic theory the early quantum concepts that had been developed by Planck and Einstein.  
It states that an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy.  
"When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.  "
The frequency of the emitted photon is then given by  
where E i and E f are the energies of the initial and final states and E i  _GREAT_GT;  E f.  
"For a hydrogen atom, Eq.  -LRB- 12.4 -RRB-  gives the expression to determine the energies of different energy states.  "
But then this equation requires the radius r of the electron orbit.  
"To calculate r, Bohr's second postulate about the angular momentum of the electron — the quantisation condition — is used.  "
The angular momentum L is given by  
Bohr's second postulate of quantisation  -LSB-  -LRB- Eq.  -LRB- 12.11 -RRB-  -RSB-  says that the allowed values of angular momentum are integral multiples of h/2 π.  
"where n is an integer, r n is the radius of n th possible orbit and v n is the speed of moving electron in the n th orbit.  "
"The allowed orbits are numbered 1, 2, 3..., according to the values of n, which is called the principal quantum number of the orbit.  "
"From Eq.  -LRB- 12.3 -RRB- , the relation between v n and r n is  "
"Combining it with Eq.  -LRB- 12.13 -RRB- , we get the following expressions for v n and r n,  "
Eq.  -LRB- 12.14 -RRB-  depicts that the orbital speed in the n orbit falls by a factor of n.  
"Using Eq.  -LRB- 12.15 -RRB- , the size of the innermost orbit  -LRB- n = 1 -RRB-  can be obtained as  "
"This is called the Bohr radius, represented by the symbol a 0.  "
"Thus, Substitution of values of h, m, ε and e gives a = 5.29 × 10 -11 m.  "
"From Eq.  -LRB- 12.15 -RRB- , it can also be seen that the radii of the orbits increase as n 2.  "
The total energy of the electron in the stationary states of the hydrogen atom can be obtained by substituting the value of orbital radius in Eq.  -LRB- 12.4 -RRB-  as  
"Substituting values, Eq.  -LRB- 12.17 -RRB-  yields  "
Atomic energies are often expressed in electron volts  -LRB- eV -RRB-  rather than joules.  
"Since 1 eV = 1.6 × 10 -19 J, Eq.  -LRB- 12.18 -RRB-  can be rewritten as  "
The negative sign of the total energy of an electron moving in an orbit means that the electron is bound with the nucleus.  
Energy will thus be required to remove the electron from the hydrogen atom to a distance infinitely far away from its nucleus  -LRB- or proton in hydrogen atom -RRB- .  
"The derivation of Eqs.  -LRB- 12.17 -RRB-  —  -LRB- 12.19 -RRB-  involves the assumption that the electronic orbits are circular, though orbits under inverse square force are, in general elliptical.  "
 -LRB- Planets move in elliptical orbits under the inverse square gravitational force of the sun. -RRB-   
"However, it was shown by the German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld  -LRB- 1868 — 1951 -RRB-  that, when the restriction of circular orbit is relaxed, these equations continue to hold even for elliptic orbits.  "
We are introduced to the Bohr Model of atom one time or the other in the course of physics.  
This model has its place in the history of quantum mechanics and particularly in explaining the structure of an atom.  
"It has become a milestone since Bohr introduced the revolutionary idea of definite energy orbits for the electrons, contrary to the classical picture requiring an accelerating particle to radiate.  "
Bohr also introduced the idea of quantisation of angular momentum of electrons moving in definite orbits.  
Thus it was a semi-classical picture of the structure of atom.  
"Now with the development of quantum mechanics, we have a better understanding of the structure of atom.  "
Solutions of the Schrödinger wave equation assign a wave-like description to the electrons bound in an atom due to attractive forces of the protons.  
An orbit of the electron in the Bohr model is the circular path of motion of an electron around the nucleus.  
"But according to quantum mechanics, we can not associate a definite path with the motion of the electrons in an atom.  "
We can only talk about the probability of finding an electron in a certain region of space around the nucleus.  
This probability can be inferred from the one-electron wave function called the orbital.  
This function depends only on the coordinates of the electron.  
It is therefore essential that we understand the subtle differences that exist in the two models:  
Bohr model is valid for only one-electron atoms/ions;  
"an energy value, assigned to each orbit, depends on the principal quantum number n in this model.  "
"We know that energy associated with a stationary state of an electron depends on n only, for one-electron atoms/ions.  "
"For a multi-electron atom/ion, this is not true.  "
"The solution of the Schrödinger wave equation, obtained for hydrogen-like atoms / ions, called the wave function, gives information about the probability of finding an electron in various regions around the nucleus.  "
This orbital has no resemblance whatsoever with the orbit defined for an electron in the Bohr model.  
"The energy of an atom is the least  -LRB- largest negative value -RRB-  when its electron is revolving in an orbit closest to the nucleus i.e., the one for which n = 1.  "
"For n = 2, 3,... the absolute value of the energy E is smaller, hence the energy is progressively larger in the outer orbits.  "
"The lowest state of the atom, called the ground state, is that of the lowest energy, with the electron revolving in the orbit of smallest radius, the Bohr radius, a.  "
"The energy of this state  -LRB- n = 1 -RRB- , E is — 13.6 eV.  "
"Therefore, the minimum energy required to free the electron from the ground state of the hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV.  "
It is called the ionisation energy of the hydrogen atom.  
This prediction of the Bohr's model is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of ionisation energy.  
"At room temperature, most of the hydrogen atoms are in ground state.  "
"When a hydrogen atom receives energy by processes such as electron collisions, the atom may acquire sufficient energy to raise the electron to higher energy states.  "
The atom is then said to be in an excited state.  
"From Eq.  -LRB- 12.19 -RRB- , for n = 2; the energy E is — 3.40 eV.  "
"or to excite the hydrogen atom from its ground state  -LRB- n = 1 -RRB-  to second excited state  -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- , 12.09 eV energy is required, and so on.  "
"Thus, as the excitation of hydrogen atom increases  -LRB- that is as n increases -RRB-  the value of minimum energy required to free the electron from the excited atom decreases.  "
"The energy level diagram for the stationary states of a hydrogen atom, computed from Eq.  -LRB- 12.19 -RRB- , is given in Fig. 12.8.  "
The principal quantum number n labels the stationary states in the ascending order of energy.  
"In this diagram, the highest energy state corresponds to n = ∞ in Eq,  -LRB- 12.19 -RRB-  and has an energy of 0 eV.  "
This is the energy of the atom when the electron is completely removed  -LRB- r = ∞ -RRB-  from the nucleus and is at rest.  
Observe how the energies of the excited states come closer and closer together as n increases.  
"Equation  -LRB- 12.21 -RRB-  is the Rydberg formula, for the spectrum of the hydrogen atom.  "
"In this relation, if we take n f = 2 and n i = 3, 4, 5..., it reduces to a form similar to Eq.  -LRB- 12.10 -RRB-  for the Balmer series.  "
The Rydberg constant R is readily identified to be  
"If we insert the values of various constants in Eq.  -LRB- 12.23 -RRB- , we get  "
This is a value very close to the value  -LRB- 1.097 × 10 7 m -1 -RRB-  obtained from the empirical Balmer formula.  
This agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the Rydberg constant provided a direct and striking confirmation of the Bohr's model.  
"Since both n f and n i are integers, this immediately shows that in transitions between different atomic levels, light is radiated in various discrete frequencies.  "
"For hydrogen spectrum, the Balmer formula corresponds to n f = 2 and n i = 3, 4, 5, etc..  "
"Such series were identified in the course of spectroscopic investigations and are known as the L yman, Balmer, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund series.  "
The electronic transitions corresponding to these series are shown in Fig. 12.9.  
The various lines in the atomic spectra are produced when electrons jump from higher energy state to a lower energy state and photons are emitted.  
These spectral lines are called emission lines.  
"But when an atom absorbs a photon that has precisely the same energy needed by the electron in a lower energy state to make transitions to a higher energy state, the process is called absorption.  "
"Thus if photons with a continuous range of frequencies pass through a rarefied gas and then are analyzed with a spectrometer, a series of dark spectral absorption lines appear in the continuous spectrum.  "
The dark lines indicate the frequencies that have been absorbed by the atoms of the gas.  
"The explanation of the hydrogen atom spectrum provided by Bohr's model was a brilliant achievement, which greatly stimulated progress towards the modern quantum theory.  "
"In 1922, Bohr was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics.  "
"Of all the postulates, Bohr made in his model of the atom, perhaps the most puzzling is his second postulate.  "
"It states that the angular momentum of the electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantised  -LRB- that is, L n = nh/2 π; n = 1, 2, 3... -RRB- .  "
Why should the angular momentum have only those values that are integral multiples of h/2 π?  
"The French physicist Louis de Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr proposed his model.  "
"We studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie's hypothesis that material particles, such as electrons, also have a wave nature.  "
C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer later experimentally verified the wave nature of electrons in 1927.  
"Louis de Broglie argued that the electron in its circular orbit, as proposed by Bohr, must be seen as a particle wave.  "
"In analogy to waves traveling on a string, particle waves too can lead to standing waves under resonant conditions.  "
"From Chapter 15 of Class XI Physics textbook, we know that when a string is plucked, a vast number of wavelengths are excited.  "
This is the quantum condition proposed by Bohr for the angular momentum of the electron  -LSB- Eq.  -LRB- 12.13 -RRB-  -RSB- .  
"In Section 12.5, we saw that this equation is the basis of explaining the discrete orbits and energy levels in hydrogen atom.  "
Thus de Broglie hypothesis provided an explanation for Bohr's second postulate for the quantisation of angular momentum of the orbiting electron.  
The quantised electron orbits and energy states are due to the wave nature of the electron and only resonant standing waves can persist.  
This model however has many limitations.  
Some are:  
 -LRB- i -RRB-  The Bohr model is applicable to hydrogenic atoms.  
It can not be extended even to mere two electron atoms such as helium.  
The analysis of atoms with more than one electron was attempted on the lines of Bohr's model for hydrogenic atoms but did not meet with any success.  
Difficulty lies in the fact that each electron interacts not only with the positively charged nucleus but also with all other electrons.  
The formulation of Bohr model involves electrical force between positively charged nucleus and electron.  
It does not include the electrical forces between electrons which necessarily appear in multi-electron atoms.  
" -LRB- ii -RRB-  While the Bohr's model correctly predicts the frequencies of the light emitted by hydrogenic atoms, the model is unable to explain the relative intensities of the frequencies in the spectrum.  "
"In emission spectrum of hydrogen, some of the visible frequencies have weak intensity, others strong.  "
Why ? Experimental observations depict that some transitions are more favored than others.  
Bohr's model is unable to account for the intensity variations.  
Bohr's model presents an elegant picture of an atom and can not be generalised to complex atoms.  
"For complex atoms we have to use a new and radical theory based on Quantum Mechanics, which provides a more complete picture of the atomic structure.  "
Imagine a crowded market place or a railway platform with people entering a gate and going towards all directions.  
Their footsteps are random and there is no phase correlation between them.  
"On the other hand, think of a large number of soldiers in a regulated march.  "
Their footsteps are very well correlated.  
See figure here.  
This is similar to the difference between light emitted by an ordinary source like a candle or a bulb and that emitted by a laser.  
The acronym LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  
"Since its development in 1960, it has entered into all areas of science and technology.  "
"It has found applications in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, surgery, engineering, etc..  "
"There are low power lasers, with a power of 0.5 mW,  "
This results in reducing the divergence of a laser beam substantially.  
"Considering that N is very large, we see that the light from a laser can be much stronger than that from an ordinary source.  "
"When astronauts of the Apollo missions visited the moon, they placed a mirror on its surface, facing the earth.  "
"Then scientists on the earth sent a strong laser beam, which was reflected by the mirror on the moon and received back on the earth.  "
The size of the reflected laser beam and the time taken for the round trip were measured.  
This allowed a very accurate determination of  -LRB- a -RRB-  the extremely small divergence of a laser beam and  -LRB- b -RRB-  the distance of the moon from the earth.  
Devices in which a controlled flow of electrons can be obtained are the basic building blocks of all the electronic circuits.  
"In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and the controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying the voltage between its different electrodes.  "
Vacuum is required in the inter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their energy on collision with the air molecules in their path.  
"In these devices the electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode  -LRB- i.e., only in one direction -RRB- .  "
"Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves.  "
"Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change the number of mobile charges in a semiconductor.  "
No external heating or large evacuated space is required by the semiconductor devices.  
"They are small in size, consume low power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability.  "
A few circuits illustrating their applications will also be described.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate to metals and insulators.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  Insulators: They have high resistivity  -LRB- or low conductivity -RRB- .  
The values of ρ and σ given above are indicative of magnitude and could well go outside the ranges as well.  
"Relative values of the resistivity are not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and semiconductors from each other.  "
"There are some other differences, which will become clear as we go along in this chapter.  "
"• Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc..  "
"• Organic polymers: polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc..  "
Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on elemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic semiconductors.  
"However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been developed signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer-electronics and molecular-electronics.  "
"In this chapter, we will restrict ourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly elemental semiconductors Si and Ge.  "
"The general concepts introduced here for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply to most of the compound semiconductors as well.  "
"According to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of any of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves.  "
But when the atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other.  
So the outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very close or could even overlap.  
This would make the nature of electron motion in a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.  
Inside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two electrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges.  
"Because of this, each electron will have a different energy level.  "
These different energy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called energy bands.  
The energy band which includes the energy levels of the valence electrons is called the valence band.  
The energy band above the valence band is called the conduction band.  
"With no external energy, all the valence electrons will reside in the valence band.  "
"If the lowest level in the conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the valence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into the conduction band.  "
Normally the conduction band is empty.  
But when it overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it.  
This is the case with metallic conductors.  
"If there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence band, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons are available in the conduction band.  "
This makes the material an insulator.  
But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain external energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the valence band.  
Then these electrons will move into the conduction band ; At the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band where other valence electrons can move.  
Thus the process creates the possibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as due to vacancies in the valence band.  
Let us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing N atoms.  
"For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit  -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- , while for Ge it is the fourth orbit  -LRB- n = 4 -RRB- .  "
The number of electrons in the outermost orbit is 4  -LRB- 2s and 2p electrons -RRB- .  
"Hence, the total number of outer electrons in the crystal is 4N.  "
The maximum possible number of electrons in the outer orbit is 8  -LRB- 2s + 6p electrons -RRB- .  
"So, for the 4N valence electrons there are 8N available energy states.  "
"At the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge, the energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are separated by an energy gap Eg  -LRB- Fig. 14.1 -RRB- .  "
The lower band which is completely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute zero is the valence band.  
"The other band consisting of 4N energy states, called the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero.  "
Consider that the Si or Ge crystal contains N atoms.  
Electrons of each atom will have discrete energies in different orbits.  
"The electron energy will be same if all the atoms are isolated, i.e., separated from each other by a large distance.  "
"However, in a crystal, the atoms are close to each other  -LRB- 2 to 3 Å -RRB-  and therefore the electrons interact with each other and also with the neighbouring atomic cores.  "
The overlap  -LRB- or interaction -RRB-  will be more felt by the electrons in the outermost orbit while the inner orbit or core electron energies may remain unaffected.  
"Therefore, for understanding electron energies in Si or Ge crystal, we need to consider the changes in the energies of the electrons in the outermost orbit only.  "
"For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit  -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- , while for Ge it is the fourth orbit  -LRB- n = 4 -RRB- .  "
The number of electrons in the outermost orbit is 4  -LRB- 2s and 2p electrons -RRB- .  
"Hence, the total number of outer electrons in the crystal is 4N.  "
The maximum possible number of outer electrons in the orbit is 8  -LRB- 2s + 6p electrons -RRB- .  
"So, out of the 4N electrons, 2N electrons are in the 2N s-states  -LRB- orbital quantum number l = 0 -RRB-  and 2N electrons are in the available 6N p-states.  "
"Obviously, some p-electron states are empty as shown in the extreme right of Figure.  "
This is the case of well separated or isolated atoms  -LRB- region A of Figure -RRB- .  
Suppose these atoms start coming nearer to each other to form a solid.  
The energies of these electrons in the outermost orbit may change  -LRB- both increase and decrease -RRB-  due to the interaction between the electrons of different atoms.  
"The 6N states for l = 1, which originally had identical energies in the isolated atoms, spread out and form an energy band  -LRB- region B in Figure -RRB- .  "
"At still smaller spacing, however, there comes a region in which the bands merge with each other.  "
The lowest energy state that is a split from the upper atomic level appears to drop below the upper state that has come from the lower atomic level.  
"In this region  -LRB- region C in Figure -RRB- , no energy gap exists where the upper and lower energy states get mixed.  "
"Finally, if the distance between the atoms further decreases, the energy bands again split apart and are separated by an energy gap Eg  -LRB- region D in Figure -RRB- .  "
The total number of available energy states 8N has been re-apportioned between the two bands  -LRB- 4N states each in the lower and upper energy bands -RRB- .  
Here the significant point is that there are exactly as many states in the lower band  -LRB- 4N -RRB-  as there are available valence electrons from the atoms  -LRB- 4N -RRB- .  
"Therefore, this band  -LRB- called the valence band -RRB-  is completely filled while the upper band is completely empty.  "
The upper band is called the conduction band.  
The lowest energy level in the conduction band is shown as EC and highest energy level in the valence band is shown as EV.  
The gap between the top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band is called the energy band gap  -LRB- Energy gap Eg -RRB- .  
"It may be large, small, or zero, depending upon the material.  "
"These different situations, are depicted in Fig. 14.2 and discussed below: Case I: This refers to a situation, as shown in Fig. 14.2 -LRB- a -RRB- .  "
One can have a metal either when the conduction band is partially filled and the balanced band is partially empty or when the conduction and valance bands overlap.  
When there is overlap electrons from valence band can easily move into the conduction band.  
This situation makes a large number of electrons available for electrical conduction.  
"When the valence band is partially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level making conduction possible.  "
"Therefore, the resistance of such materials is low or the conductivity is high.  "
"FIGURE 14.2 Difference between energy bands of  -LRB- a -RRB-  metals,  -LRB- b -RRB-  insulators and  -LRB- c -RRB-  semiconductors.  "
"Case II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2 -LRB- b -RRB- , a large band gap Eg exists  -LRB- Eg  _GREAT_GT;  3eV -RRB- .  "
"There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore no electrical conduction is possible.  "
Note that the energy gap is so large that electrons can not be excited from the valence band to the conduction band by thermal excitation.  
This is the case of insulators.  
Case III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2 -LRB- c -RRB- .  
Here a finite but small band gap  -LRB- Eg  _LESS_LT;  3eV -RRB-  exists.  
"Because of the small band gap, at room temperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough energy to cross the energy gap and enter the conduction band.  "
These electrons  -LRB- though small in numbers -RRB-  can move in the conduction band.  
"Hence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the insulators.  "
"In this section we have made a broad classification of metals, conductors and semiconductors.  "
In the section which follows you will learn the conduction process in semiconductors.  
We shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose lattice structure is shown in Fig. 14.3.  
The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the crystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5  -LRB- a -RRB- .  
"The neighborhood, from which the free electron  -LRB- with charge —q -RRB-  has come out leaves a vacancy with an effective charge  -LRB- +q -RRB- .  "
This vacancy with the effective positive electronic charge is called a hole.  
The hole behaves as an apparent free particle with effective positive charge.  
"In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons, ne is equal to the number of holes, nh ; That is ne = nh = ni, where ni is called intrinsic carrier concentration.  "
"Semiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from electrons, the holes also move.  "
Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown in Fig. 14.5 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
The movement of holes can be visualised as shown in Fig. 14.5 -LRB- b -RRB-   
An electron from the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to the vacant site 1  -LRB- hole -RRB- .  
"Thus, after such a jump, the hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an electron.  "
"Therefore, apparently, the hole has moved from site 1 to site 2.  "
Note that the electron originally set free  -LRB- Fig. 14.5 -LRB- a -RRB-  -RRB-  is not involved in this process of hole motion.  
"The free electron moves completely independently as conduction electron and gives rise to an electron current, Ie under an applied electric field.  "
"Remember that the motion of hole is only a convenient way of describing the actual motion of bound electrons, whenever there is an empty bond anywhere in the crystal.  "
"Under the action of an electric field, these holes move towards negative potential giving the hole current, Ih.  "
"The total current, I is thus the sum of the electron current Ie and the hole current Ih: I = Ie + Ih.  "
"It may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction electrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in which the electrons recombine with the holes.  "
"At equilibrium, the rate of generation is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers.  "
The recombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole.

Schematic model of generation of hole at site 1 and conduction electron due to thermal energy at moderate temperatures.  
Simplified representation of possible thermal motion of a hole.  
We shall now discuss how the doping changes the number of charge carriers  -LRB- and hence the conductivity -RRB-  of semiconductors.  
 -LRB- i -RRB-  n-type semiconductor: Suppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent element as shown in Fig. 14.7.  
This is because the four electrons participating in bonding are seen as part of the effective core of the atom by the fifth electron.  
As a result the ionisation energy required to set this electron free is very small and even at room temperature it will be free to move in the lattice of the semiconductor.  
"For example, the energy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium, and 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this electron from its atom.  "
This is in contrast to the energy required to jump the forbidden band  -LRB- about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for silicon -RRB-  at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor.  
"Thus, the pentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and hence is known as donor impurity.  "
The number of electrons made available for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the doping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature.  
"On the other hand, the number of free electrons  -LRB- with an equal number of holes -RRB-  generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature.  "
But the rate of recombination of holes would increase due to the increase in the number of electrons.  
"As a result, the number of holes would get reduced further.  "
"Thus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons can be made much larger than the number of holes.  "
"Hence in an extrinsic semiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons become the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers.  "
"These semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type semiconductors.  "
So the bond between the fourth neighbor and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as shown in Fig. 14.8.  
Thus the hole is available for conduction.  
With very small supply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level EA and ionise the acceptor negatively.  
"Alternately, we can also say that with very small supply of energy the hole from level EA sinks down into the valence band.  "
Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain external energy. -RRB-   
"At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get ionised leaving holes in the valence band.  "
Thus at room temperature the density of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in the extrinsic semiconductor.  
"Though the above description is grossly approximate and hypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals, insulators and semiconductors  -LRB- extrinsic and intrinsic -RRB-  in a simple manner.  "
"The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon the energy gap between their conduction and valence bands.  "
"For C -LRB- diamond -RRB- , Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5.4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV, respectively.  "
Sn also is a group IV element but it is a metal because the energy gap in its case is 0 eV.  
"A p-n junction is the basic building block of many semiconductor devices like diodes, transistor, etc..  "
A clear understanding of the junction behavior is important to analyze the working of other semiconductor devices.  
We will now try to understand how a junction is formed and how the junction behaves under the influence of external applied voltage  -LRB- also called bias -RRB- .  
Consider a thin p-type silicon  -LRB- p-Si -RRB-  semiconductor wafer.  
"By adding precisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer can be converted into n-Si.  "
There are several processes by which a semiconductor can be formed.  
"The wafer now contains p-region and n-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.  "
Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction: diffusion and drift.  
"We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons  -LRB- number of electrons per unit volume -RRB-  is more compared to the concentration of holes.  "
"Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration of electrons.  "
This motion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.  
"When an electron diffuses from n → p, it leaves behind an ionised donor on n-side.  "
This ionised donor  -LRB- positive charge -RRB-  is immobile as it is bonded to the surrounding atoms.  
"As the electrons continue to diffuse from n → p, a layer of positive charge  -LRB- or positive space-charge region -RRB-  on n-side of the junction is developed.  "
"Similarly, when a hole diffuses from p → n due to the concentration gradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor  -LRB- negative charge -RRB-  which is immobile.  "
"As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge  -LRB- or negative space-charge region -RRB-  on the p-side of the junction is developed.  "
The thickness of depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a micrometre.  
"Due to this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves to n-side and a hole on n - side of the junction moves to p-side.  "
The motion of charge carriers due to the electric field is called drift.  
"Thus a drift current, which is opposite in direction to the diffusion current  -LRB- Fig. 14.10 -RRB-  starts.  "
"Initially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small.  "
"As the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions on either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric field strength and hence drift current.  "
This process continues until the diffusion current equals the drift current.  
Thus a p-n junction is formed.  
In a p-n junction under equilibrium there is no net current.  
The loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of electron by the p-region causes a difference of potential across the junction of the two regions.  
The polarity of this potential is such as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of equilibrium exists.  
Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at equilibrium and the potential across the junction.  
"The n-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired electrons.  "
The n material is thus positive relative to the p material.  
"Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of electron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a barrier potential.  "
It is a two terminal device.  
A p-n junction diode is symbolically represented as shown in Fig. 14.12 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
The direction of arrow indicates the conventional direction of current  -LRB- when the diode is under forward bias -RRB- .  
The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered by applying an external voltage V across the diode.  
The situation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium  -LRB- without bias -RRB-  is shown in Fig. 14.11 -LRB- a -RRB-  and  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the voltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible.  
 -LRB- This is because the resistance of the depletion region — a region where there are no charges — is very high compared to the resistance of n-side and p-side. -RRB-   
The direction of the applied voltage  -LRB- V -RRB-  is opposite to the built-in potential V0.  
"As a result, the depletion layer width decreases and the barrier height is reduced  -LRB- Fig. 14.13 -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
The effective barrier height under forward bias is  -LRB- V0 — V -RRB- .  
"If we increase the applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced and more number of carriers will have the required energy.  "
The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region.  
The direction of applied voltage is same as the direction of barrier potential.  
"As a result, the barrier height increases and the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field.  "
"The effective barrier height under reverse bias is  -LRB- V0 + V -RRB- ,  -LRB- Fig. 14.15 -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
This suppresses the flow of electrons from n → p and holes from p → n.  
"Thus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode under forward bias.  "
This drift of carriers gives rise to current.  
The drift current is of the order of a few μA.  
This is quite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority side to their majority side across the junction.  
The drift current is also there under forward bias but it is negligible  -LRB- μA -RRB-  when compared with current due to injected carriers which is usually in mA.  
The diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied voltage.  
"After the characteristic voltage, the diode current increases significantly  -LRB- exponentially -RRB- , even for a very small increase in the diode bias voltage.  "
This voltage is called the threshold voltage or cut-in voltage  -LRB- ~0.2 V for germanium diode and ~0.7 V for silicon diode -RRB- .  
"For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small  -LRB- ~μA -RRB-  and almost remains constant with change in bias.  "
It is called reverse saturation current.  
"However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias  -LRB- break down voltage -RRB- , the current suddenly increases.  "
This special action of the diode is discussed later in Section 14.8.  
The general purpose diode are not used beyond the reverse saturation current region.  
The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly allows the flow of current only in one direction  -LRB- forward bias -RRB- .  
The forward bias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance.  
This property is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next section.  
From the V-ICharacteristic of a junction diode we see that it allows current to pass only when it is forward biased.  
So if an alternating voltage is applied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle when the diode is forward biased.  
This property is used to rectify alternating voltages and the circuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier.  
"Such rectifier circuit, as shown in Fig. 14.18, is called a half-wave rectifier.  "
The secondary of a transformer supplies the desired ac voltage across terminals A and B.  
"When the voltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased and it conducts.  "
"When A is negative, the diode is reverse-biased and it does not conduct.  "
The reverse saturation current of a diode is negligible and can be considered equal to zero for practical purposes.  
 -LRB- The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must be sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at the secondary of the transformer to protect the diode from reverse breakdown. -RRB-   
"In the next positive half-cycle, again we get the output voltage.  "
"Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is restricted to only one direction and is said to be rectified.  "
Since the rectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is called as half-wave rectifier.  
"Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier.  "
As can be seen from Fig.14.19 -LRB- c -RRB-  the voltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage.  
"Each diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate cycles.  "
"Thus, the output between their common terminals and the center - tap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output.  "
 -LRB- Note that there is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a center-tap transformer but needs four diodes. -RRB-   
Suppose the input voltage to A with respect to the center tap at any instant is positive.  
"It is clear that, at that instant, voltage at B being out of phase will be negative as shown in Fig.14.19 -LRB- b -RRB- .  "
"So, diode D1 gets forward biased and conducts  -LRB- while D2 being reverse biased is not conducting -RRB- .  "
"Hence, during this positive half cycle we get an output current  -LRB- and a output voltage across the load resistor RL -RRB-  as shown in Fig.14.19  -LRB- c -RRB- .  "
"In the course of the ac cycle when the voltage at A becomes negative with respect to center tap, the voltage at B would be positive.  "
"In this part of the cycle diode D1 would not conduct but diode D2 would, giving an output current and output voltage  -LRB- across RL -RRB-  during the negative half cycle of the input ac.  "
"Thus, we get output voltage during both the positive as well as the negative half of the cycle.  "
"Obviously, this is a more efficient circuit for getting rectified voltage or current than the half-wave rectifier.  "
The rectified voltage is in the form of pulses of the shape of half sinusoids.  
Though it is unidirectional it does not have a steady value.  
To get steady dc output from the pulsating voltage normally a capacitor is connected across the output terminals  -LRB- parallel to the load RL -RRB- .  
One can also use an inductor in series with RL for the same purpose.  
"Since these additional circuits appear to filter out the ac ripple and give a pure dc voltage, so they are called filters.  "
Now we shall discuss the role of capacitor in filtering.  
"When the voltage across the capacitor is rising, it gets charged.  "
"Note that after the breakdown voltage Vz, a large change in the current can be produced by almost insignificant change in the reverse bias voltage.  "
"In other words, Zener voltage remains constant, even though current through the Zener diode varies over a wide range.  "
This property of the Zener diode is used for regulating supply voltages so that they are constant.  
Let us understand how reverse current suddenly increases at the breakdown voltage.  
We know that reverse current is due to the flow of electrons  -LRB- minority carriers -RRB-  from p → n and holes from n → p.  
"As the reverse bias voltage is increased, the electric field at the junction becomes significant.  "
"When the reverse bias voltage V = Vz, then the electric field strength is high enough to pull valence electrons from the host atoms on the p-side which are accelerated to n-side.  "
These electrons account for high current observed at the breakdown.  
The emission of electrons from the host atoms due to the high electric field is known as internal field emission or field ionisation.  
The electric field required for field ionisation is of the order of 106 V/m.  
"Zener diode as a voltage regulator We know that when the ac input voltage of a rectifier fluctuates, its rectified output also fluctuates.  "
"To get a constant dc voltage from the dc unregulated output of a rectifier, we use a Zener diode.  "
The circuit diagram of a voltage regulator using a Zener diode is shown in Fig. 14.22.  
The unregulated dc voltage  -LRB- filtered output of a rectifier -RRB-  is connected to the Zener diode through a series resistance Rs such that the Zener diode is reverse biased.  
"If the input voltage increases, the current through Rs and Zener diode also increases.  "
This increases the voltage drop across Rs without any change in the voltage across the Zener diode.  
"This is because in the breakdown region, Zener voltage remains constant even though the current through the Zener diode changes.  "
"Similarly, if the input voltage decreases, the current through Rs and Zener diode also decreases.  "
The voltage drop across Rs decreases without any change in the voltage across the Zener diode.  
"Thus any increase/decrease in the input voltage results in, increase/decrease of the voltage drop across Rs without any change in voltage across the Zener diode.  "
Thus the Zener diode acts as a voltage regulator.  
We have to select the Zener diode according to the required output voltage and accordingly the series resistance Rs.  
"We have seen so far, how a semiconductor diode behaves under applied electrical inputs.  "
"In this section, we learn about semiconductor diodes in which carriers are generated by photons  -LRB- photo-excitation -RRB- .  "
All these devices are called optoelectronic devices.  
We shall study the functioning of the following optoelectronic devices:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Photodiodes used for detecting optical signal  -LRB- photodetectors -RRB- .  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Light emitting diodes  -LRB- LED -RRB-  which convert electrical energy into light.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  Photovoltaic devices which convert optical radiation into electricity  -LRB- solar cells -RRB- .  
A Photodiode is again a special purpose p-n junction diode fabricated with a transparent window to allow light to fall on the diode.  
It is operated under reverse bias.  
The diode is fabricated such that the generation of e-h pairs takes place in or near the depletion region of the diode.  
"Due to electric field of the junction, electrons and holes are separated before they recombine.  "
The direction of the electric field is such that electrons reach n-side and holes reach p-side ; Electrons are collected on n-side and holes are collected on p-side giving rise to an emf.  
"When an external load is connected, current flows.  "
The magnitude of the photocurrent depends on the intensity of incident light  -LRB- photocurrent is proportional to incident light intensity -RRB- .  
"It is easier to observe the change in the current with change in the light intensity, if a reverse bias is applied.  "
Thus photodiode can be used as a photodetector to detect optical signals.  
The circuit diagram used for the measurement of I-V characteristics of a photodiode is shown in Fig. 14.23 -LRB- a -RRB-  and a typical I-V characteristics in Fig. 14.23 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Light emitting diode: It is a heavily doped p-n junction which under forward bias emits spontaneous radiation.  
The diode is encapsulated with a transparent cover so that emitted light can come out.  
"When the diode is forward biased, electrons are sent from n → p  -LRB- where they are minority carriers -RRB-  and holes are sent from p → n  -LRB- where they are minority carriers -RRB- .  "
"At the junction boundary the concentration of minority carriers increases compared to the equilibrium concentration  -LRB- i.e., when there is no bias -RRB- .  "
"Thus at the junction boundary on either side of the junction, excess minority carriers are there which recombine with majority carriers near the junction.  "
"On recombination, the energy is released in the form of photons.  "
Photons with energy equal to or slightly less than the band gap are emitted.  
"When the forward current of the diode is small, the intensity of light emitted is small.  "
"As the forward current increases, intensity of light increases and reaches a maximum.  "
Further increase in the forward current results in decrease of light intensity.  
LEDs are biased such that the light emitting efficiency is maximum.  
The V-I Characteristics of a LED is similar to that of a Si junction diode.  
But the threshold voltages are much higher and slightly different for each color.  
"The reverse breakdown voltages of LEDs are very low, typically around 5V.  "
So care should be taken that high reverse voltages do not appear across them.  
"LEDs that can emit red, yellow, orange, green and blue light are commercially available.  "
The compound semiconductor Gallium Arsenide — Phosphide  -LRB- GaAs1—xPx -RRB-  is used for making LEDs of different colors.  
GaAs0.6P0.4  -LRB- Eg ~1.9 eV -RRB-  is used for red LED.  
GaAs  -LRB- Eg ~1.4 eV -RRB-  is used for making infrared LED.  
"These LEDs find extensive use in remote controls, burglar alarm systems, optical communication, etc..  "
Extensive research is being done for developing white LEDs which can replace incandescent lamps.  
LEDs have the following advantages over conventional incandescent low power lamps:  -LRB- i -RRB-  Low operational voltage and less power.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Fast action and no warm-up time required.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  The bandwidth of emitted light is 100 Å to 500 Å or in other words it is nearly  -LRB- but not exactly -RRB-  monochromatic.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Long life and ruggedness.  
 -LRB- v -RRB-  Fast on-off switching capability.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  Solar cell: A solar cell is basically a p-n junction which generates emf when solar radiation falls on the p-n junction.  
A simple p-n junction solar cell is shown in Fig. 14.24.  
A p-Si wafer of about 300 μ m is taken over which a thin layer  -LRB- ~0.3 μm -RRB-  of n-Si is grown on one-side by diffusion process.  
The other side of p-Si is coated with a metal  -LRB- back contact -RRB- .  
"On the top of n-Si layer, metal finger electrode  -LRB- or metallic grid -RRB-  is deposited.  "
This acts as a front contact.  
The metallic grid occupies only a very small fraction of the cell area  -LRB-  _LESS_LT;  15% -RRB-  so that light can be incident on the cell from the top.  
Electrons are swept to n-side and holes to p-side.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  the electrons reaching the n-side are collected by the front contact and holes reaching p-side are collected by the back contact.  
Thus p-side becomes positive and n-side becomes negative giving rise to photovoltage.  
When an external load is connected as shown in the Fig. 14.25 -LRB- a -RRB-  a photocurrent IL flows through the load.  
A typical I-V characteristics of a solar cell is shown in the Fig. 14.25 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
Note that the I—V characteristics of solar cell is drawn in the fourth quadrant of the coordinate axes.  
This is because a solar cell does not draw current but supplies the same to the load.  
Semiconductors with band gap close to 1.5 eV are ideal materials for solar cell fabrication.  
Note that sunlight is not always required for a solar cell.  
Any light with photon energies greater than the bandgap will do.  
A brief description of the three segments of a transistor is given below: • Emitter: This is the segment on one side of the transistor shown in Fig. 14.27 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
It is of moderate size and heavily doped.  
It supplies a large number of majority carriers for the current flow through the transistor.  
• Base: This is the central segment.  
It is very thin and lightly doped.  
• Collector: This segment collects a major portion of the majority carriers supplied by the emitter.  
The collector side is moderately doped and larger in size as compared to the emitter.  
"We have seen earlier in the case of a p-n junction, that there is a formation of depletion region acorss the junction.  "
In case of a transistor depletion regions are formed at the emitter base-junction and the base-collector junction.  
"For understanding the action of a transistor, we have to consider the nature of depletion regions formed at these junctions.  "
The charge carriers move across different regions of the transistor when proper voltages are applied across its terminals.  
The biasing of the transistor is done differently for different uses.  
The transistor can be used in two distinct ways.  
"Basically, it was invented to function as an amplifier, a device which produces a enlarged copy of a signal.  "
But later its use as a switch acquired equal importance.  
We shall study both these functions and the ways the transistor is biased to achieve these mutually exclusive functions.  
First we shall see what gives the transistor its amplifying capabilities.  
"The transistor works as an amplifier, with its emitter-base junction forward biased and the base-collector junction reverse biased.  "
"This situation is shown in Fig. 14.28, where VCC and VEE are used for creating the respective biasing.  "
When the transistor is biased in this way it is said to be in active state.  
We represent the voltage between emitter and base as VEB and that between the collector and the base as VCB.  
"Fig. 14.28, base is a common terminal for the two power supplies whose other terminals are connected to emitter and collector, respectively.  "
"So the two power supplies are represented as VEE, and VCC, respectively.  "
"In circuits, where emitter is the common terminal, the power supply between the base and the emitter is represented as VBB and that between collector and emitter as VCC.  "
Let us see now the paths of current carriers in the transistor with emitter-base junction forward biased and base-collector junction reverse biased.  
"The heavily doped emitter has a high concentration of majority carriers, which will be holes in a p-n-p transistor and electrons in an n-p-n transistor.  "
These majority carriers enter the base region in large numbers.  
The base is thin and lightly doped.  
So the majority carriers there would be few.  
In a p-n-p transistor the majority carriers in the base are electrons since base is of n-type semiconductor.  
The large number of holes entering the base from the emitter swamps the small number of electrons there.  
"As the base collector-junction is reverse - biased, these holes, which appear as minority carriers at the junction, can easily cross the junction and enter the collector.  "
The base is made thin so that most of the holes find themselves near the reverse-biased base-collector junction and so cross the junction instead of moving to the base terminal.  
If we represent the hole current and the electron current crossing the forward biased junction by Ih and Ie respectively then the total current in a forward biased diode is the sum Ih + Ie.  
"We see that the emitter current IE = Ih + Ie but the base current IB  _LESS_LT;  _LESS_LT;  Ih + Ie, because a major part of IE goes to collector instead of coming out of the base terminal.  "
The base current is thus a small fraction of the emitter current.  
The current entering into the emitter from outside is equal to the emitter current IE.  
Similarly the current emerging from the base terminal is IB and that from collector terminal is IC.  
It is obvious from the above description and also from a straight forward application of Kirchhoff's law to Fig. 14.28  -LRB- a -RRB-  that the emitter current is the sum of collector current and base current.  
Our description of the direction of motion of the holes is identical with the direction of the conventional current.  
But the direction of motion of electrons is just opposite to that of the current.  
Thus in a p-n-p transistor the current enters from emitter into base whereas in a n-p-n transistor it enters from the base into the emitter.  
The arrowhead in the emitter shows the direction of the conventional current.  
The description about the paths followed by the majority and minority carriers in a n-p-n is exactly the same as that for the p-n-p transistor.  
"But the current paths are exactly opposite, as shown in Fig. 14.28.  "
In Fig. 14.28 -LRB- b -RRB-  the electrons are the majority carriers supplied by the n-type emitter region.  
"They cross the thin p-base region and are able to reach the collector to give the collector current, IC.  "
"In a transistor, only three terminals are available, viz., Emitter  -LRB- E -RRB- , Base  -LRB- B -RRB-  and Collector  -LRB- C -RRB- .  "
"Therefore, in a circuit the input/output connections have to be such that one of these  -LRB- E, B or C -RRB-  is common to both the input and the output.  "
"Accordingly, the transistor can be connected in either of the following three configurations: Common Emitter  -LRB- CE -RRB- , Common Base  -LRB- CB -RRB- , Common Collector  -LRB- CC -RRB- .  "
The transistor is most widely used in the CE configuration and we shall restrict our discussion to only this configuration.  
"Since more commonly used transistors are n-p-n Si transistors, we shall confine our discussion to such transistors only.  "
With p-n-p transistors the polarities of the external power supplies are to be inverted.  
"When a transistor is used in CE configuration, the input is between the base and the emitter and the output is between the collector and the emitter.  "
The variation of the base current IB with the base-emitter voltage VBE is called the input characteristic.  
"Similarly, the variation of the collector current IC with the collector-emitter voltage VCE is called the output characteristic.  "
You will see that the output characteristics are controlled by the input characteristics.  
This implies that the collector current changes with the base current.  
The input and the output characteristics of an n-p-n transistors can be studied by using the circuit shown in Fig. 14.29.  
"To study the input characteristics of the transistor in CE configuration, a curve is plotted between the base current IB against the base-emitter voltage VBE.  "
The FIGURE 14.29 Circuit arrangement for studying the input and output characteristics of n-p-n transistor in configuration.  
The collector-emitter voltage VCE is kept fixed while studying the dependence of IB on VBE.  
We are interested to obtain the input characteristic when the transistor is in active state.  
So the collector-emitter voltage VCE is kept large enough to make the base collector junction reverse biased.  
"Since VCE = VCB + VBE and for Si transistor VBE is 0.6 to 0.7 V, VCE must be sufficiently larger than 0.7 V.  "
The plot of IC versus VCE for different fixed values of IB gives one output characteristic.  
So there will be different output characteristics corresponding to different values of IB as shown in Fig. 14.30 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
The linear segments of both the input and output characteristics can be used to calculate some important ac parameters of transistors as shown below.  
"This is dynamic  -LRB- ac resistance -RRB-  and as can be seen from the input characteristic, its value varies with the operating current in the transistor.  "
The value of ri can be anything from a few hundreds to a few thousand ohms.  
"FIGURE 14.30:  -LRB- a -RRB-  Typical input characteristics, and  -LRB- b -RRB-  Typical output characteristics.  "
"The output characteristics show that initially for very small values of VCE, IC increases almost linearly.  "
This happens because the base-collector junction is not reverse biased and the transistor is not in active state.  
"In fact, the transistor is in the saturation state and the current is controlled by the supply voltage VCC  -LRB- = VCE -RRB-  in this part of the characteristic.  "
"When VCE is more than that required to reverse bias the base-collector junction, IC increases very little with VCE.  "
The reciprocal of the slope of the linear part of the output characteristic gives the values of ro.  
The output resistance of the transistor is mainly controlled by the bias of the base - collector junction.  
The high magnitude of the output resistance  -LRB- of the order of 100 kΩ -RRB-  is due to the reverse-biased state of this diode.  
"This also explains why the resistance at the initial part of the characteristic, when the transistor is in saturation state, is very low.  "
This is also known as small signal current gain and its value is very large.  
If we simply find the ratio of IC and IB we get what is called dc β of the transistor.  
"Since IC increases with IB almost linearly and IC = 0 when IB = 0, the values of both βdc and βac are nearly equal.  "
"So, for most calculations βdc can be used.  "
Both βac and βdc vary with VCE and IB  -LRB- or IC -RRB-  slightly.  
As mentioned earlier we have confined only to the CE configuration and will be concentrating on the biasing and the operation region to understand the working of a device.  
When the transistor is used in the cutoff or saturation state it acts as a switch.  
"On the other hand for using the transistor as an amplifier, it has to operate in the active region.  "
We shall treat VBB as the dc input voltage Vi and VCE as the dc output voltage VO.  
Let us see how Vo changes as Vi increases from zero onwards.  
"In the case of Si transistor, as long as input Vi is less than 0.6 V, the transistor will be in cut off state and current IC will be zero.  "
"With increase of Vi, IC increases almost linearly and so Vo decreases linearly till its value becomes less than about 1.0 V.  "
"Beyond this, the change becomes non linear and transistor goes into saturation state.  "
With further increase in Vi the output voltage is found to decrease further towards zero though it may never become zero.  
Let us see now how the transistor is operated as a switch.  
"As long as Vi is low and unable to forward-bias the transistor, Vo is high  -LRB- at VCC -RRB- .  "
"If Vi is high enough to drive the transistor into saturation, then Vo is low, very near to zero.  "
When the transistor is not conducting it is said to be switched off and when it is driven into saturation it is said to be switched on.  
"Alternatively, we can say that a low input to the transistor gives a high output and a high input gives a low output.  "
The switching circuits are designed in such a way that the transistor does not remain in active state.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Transistor as an amplifier For using the transistor as an amplifier we will use the active region of the Vo versus ViCurve.  
The slope of the linear part of the curve represents the rate of change of the output with the input.  
It is negative because the output is VCC—ICRC and not ICRC.  
That is why as input voltage of the CE amplifier increases its output voltage decreases and the output is said to be out of phase with the input.  
If we consider ΔVo and ΔVi as small changes in the output and input voltages then ΔVo/ΔVi is called the small signal voltage gain AV of the amplifier.  
"If the VBB voltage has a fixed value corresponding to the mid point of the active region, the circuit will behave as a CE amplifier with voltage gain ΔVo/ΔVi.  "
We can express the voltage gain AV in terms of the resistors in the circuit and the current gain of the transistor as follows.  
But ΔVBE is negligibly small in comparison to ΔIBRB in this circuit.  
Thus the linear portion of the active region of the transistor can be exploited for the use in amplifiers.  
Transistor as an amplifier  -LRB- CE configuration -RRB-  is discussed in detail in the next section.  
To operate the transistor as an amplifier it is necessary to fix its operating point somewhere in the middle of its active region.  
The dc voltage VCE = VCC - ICRC would also remain constant.  
"The operating values of VCE and IB determine the operating point, of the amplifier.  "
"As a consequence the collector current also will have sinusoidal variations superimposed on the value of IC, producing in turn corresponding change in the value of VO.  "
We can measure the ac variations across the input and output terminals by blocking the dc voltages by large capacitors.  
In the discription of the amplifier given above we have not considered any ac signal.  
"In general, amplifiers are used to amplify alternating signals.  "
Now let us superimpose an ac input signal vi  -LRB- to be amplified -RRB-  on the bias VBB -LRB- dc -RRB-  as shown in Fig. 14.32.  
The output is taken between the collector and the ground.  
"The working of an amplifier can be easily understood, if we first assume that vi = 0.  "
The change in VBE can be related to the input resistance ri  -LRB- see Eq.  -LRB- 14.8 -RRB-  -RRB-  and the change in IB.  
The change in IB causes a change in IC.  
Usually βac is close to βdc in the linear region of the output characteristics.  
This means that an external input is necessary to sustain ac signal in the output for an amplifier.  
"In an oscillator, we get ac output without any external input signal.  "
"In other words, the output in an oscillator is self-sustained.  "
"To attain this, an amplifier is taken.  "
The feedback can be achieved by inductive coupling  -LRB- through mutual inductance -RRB-  or LC or RC networks.  
Note that the coils T2 and T1 are wound on the same core and hence are inductively coupled through their mutual inductance.  
"As in an amplifier, the base-emitter junction is forward biased while the base-collector junction is reverse biased.  "
Detailed biasing circuits actually used have been omitted for simplicity.  
Let us try to understand how oscillations are built.  
Suppose switch S1 is put on to apply proper bias for the first time.  
"Obviously, a surge of collector current flows in the transistor.  "
This current flows through the coil T2 where terminals are numbered 3 and 4  -LRB- Fig. 14.33 -LRB- b -RRB-  -RRB- .  
"This current does not reach full amplitude instantaneously but increases from X to Y, as shown in Fig.  -LRB- 14.33 -LRB- c -RRB-  -LRB- i -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
The inductive coupling between coil T2 and coil T1 now causes a current to flow in the emitter circuit  -LRB- note that this actually is the 'feedback' from input to output -RRB- .  
"As a result of this positive feedback, this current  -LRB- in T1; emitter current -RRB-  also increases from X´ to Y´  -LRB- Fig. 14.33 -LRB- c -RRB-  -LRB- ii -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
The current in T2  -LRB- collector current -RRB-  connected in the collector circuit acquires the value Y when the transistor becomes saturated.  
This means that maximum collector current is flowing and can increase no further.  
"Since there is no further change in collector current, the magnetic field around T2 ceases to grow.  "
"As soon as the field becomes static, there will be no further feedback from T2 to T1.  "
"Without continued feedback, the emitter current begins to fall.  "
"Consequently, collector current decreases from Y towards Z  -LRB- Fig. 14.33 -LRB- c -RRB-  -LRB- i -RRB-  -RRB- .  "
"However, a decrease of collector current causes the magnetic field to decay around the coil T2.  "
"Thus, T1 is now seeing a decaying field in T2  -LRB- opposite from what it saw when the field was growing at the initial start operation -RRB- .  "
This section is intended to provide the first step in our understanding of digital electronics.  
We shall restrict our study to some basic building blocks of digital electronics  -LRB- called Logic Gates -RRB-  which process the digital signals in a specific manner.  
"Logic gates are used in calculators, digital watches, computers, robots, industrial control systems, and in telecommunications.  "
A light switch in your house can be used as an example of a digital circuit.  
The light is either ON or OFF depending on the switch position.  
"When the light is ON, the output value is '1' ; When the light is OFF the output value is '0'.  "
The inputs are the position of the light switch.  
The switch is placed either in the ON or OFF position to activate the light.  
A gate is a digital circuit that follows curtain logical relationship between the input and output voltages.  
"Therefore, they are generally known as logic gates— gates because they control the flow of information.  "
"The five common logic gates used are NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR.  "
Truth tables help understand the behavior of logic gates.  
These logic gates can be realized using semiconductor devices.  
" -LRB- i -RRB-  NOT gate: This is the most basic gate, with one input and one output.  "
It produces a '1' output if the input is '0' and vice-versa.  
"That is, it produces an inverted version of the input at its output.  "
This is why it is also known as an inverter.  
The commonly used symbol together with the truth table for this gate is given in Fig. 14.35.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  OR Gate: An OR gate has two or more inputs with one output.  
The logic symbol and truth table are shown in Fig. 14.36.  
"The output Y is 1 when either input A or input B or both are 1s, that is, if any of the input is high, the output is high.  "
"Apart from carrying out the above mathematical logic operation, this gate can be used for modifying the pulse waveform as explained in the following example.  "
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  AND Gate: An AND gate has two or more inputs and one output.  
The output Y of AND gate is 1 only when input A and input B are both 1.  
The logic symbol and truth table for this gate are given in Fig. 14.38 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  NAND Gate: This is an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.  
"If inputs A and B are both '1', the output Y is not '1'.  "
The gate gets its name from this NOT AND behavior.  
Figure 14.40 shows the symbol and truth table of NAND gate.  
"NAND gates are also called Universal Gates since by using these gates you can realize other basic gates like OR, AND and NOT  -LRB- Exercises 14.16 and 14.17 -RRB- .  "
 -LRB- v -RRB-  NOR Gate: It has two or more inputs and one output.  
A NOT-operation applied after OR gate gives a NOT-OR gate  -LRB- or simply NOR gate -RRB- .  
"Its output Y is '1' only when both inputs A and B are '0', i.e., neither one input nor the other is '1'.  "
The symbol and truth table for NOR gate is given in Fig. 14.42.  
"NOR gates are considered as universal gates because you can obtain all the gates like AND, OR, NOT by using only NOR gates  -LRB- Exercises 14.18 and 14.19 -RRB- .  "
"The conventional method of making circuits is to choose components like diodes, transistor, R, L, C etc., and connect them by soldering wires in the desired manner.  "
"Inspite of the miniaturisation introduced by the discovery of transistors, such circuits were still bulky.  "
"Apart from this, such circuits were less reliable and less shock proof.  "
Such a circuit is known as Integrated Circuit  -LRB- IC -RRB- .  
The most widely used technology is the Monolithic Integrated Circuit.  
"In fact ICs are found in almost all electrical devices like cars, televisions, CD players, cell phones etc..  "
The miniaturisation that made the modern personal computer possible could never have happened without the IC.  
"ICs are electronic devices that contain many transistors, resistors, capacitors, connecting wires — all in one package.  "
You must have heard of the microprocessor.  
"The microprocessor is an IC that processes all information in a computer, like keeping track of what keys are pressed, running programs, games etc..  "
The IC was first invented by Jack Kilky at Texas Instruments in 1958 and he was awarded Nobel Prize for this in 2000.  
ICs are produced on a piece of semiconductor crystal  -LRB- or chip -RRB-  by a process called photolithography.  
"Thus, the entire Information Technology  -LRB- IT -RRB-  industry hinges on semiconductors.  "
"Over the years, the complexity of ICs has increased while the size of its features continued to shrink.  "
"In the past five decades, a dramatic miniaturisation in computer technology has made modern day computers faster and smaller.  "
"In the 1970s, Gordon Moore, co-founder of INTEL, pointed out that the memory capacity of a chip  -LRB- IC -RRB-  approximately doubled every one and a half years.  "
This is popularly known as Moore's law.  
"The number of transistors per chip has risen exponentially and each year computers are becoming more powerful, yet cheaper than the year before.  "
Communication is the act of transmission of information.  
Every living creature in the world experiences the need to impart or receive information almost continuously with others in the surrounding world.  
"For communication to be successful, it is essential that the sender and the receiver understand a common language.  "
Man has constantly made endeavors to improve the quality of communication with other human beings.  
"It would be worthwhile to look at the major milestones in events that promoted developments in communications, as presented in Table 15.1.  "
"Modern communication has its roots in the 19 th and 20 th century in the work of scientists like J.C. Bose, F.B. Morse, G. Marconi and Alexander Graham Bell.  "
The pace of development seems to have increased dramatically after the first half of the 20 th century.  
We can hope to see many more accomplishments in the coming decades.  
"The aim of this chapter is to introduce the concepts of communication, namely the mode of communication, the need for modulation, production and deduction of amplitude modulation.  "
Communication pervades all stages of life of all living creatures.  
"Irrespective of its nature, every communication system has three essential elements- transmitter, medium/channel and receiver.  "
The block diagram shown in Fig. 15.1 depicts the general form of a communication system.  
The purpose of the transmitter is to convert the message signal produced by the source of information into a form suitable for transmission through the channel.  
"If the output of the information source is a non-electrical signal like a voice signal, a transducer converts it to electrical form before giving it as an input to the transmitter.  "
When a transmitted signal propagates along the channel it may get distorted due to channel imperfection.  
"Moreover, noise adds to the transmitted signal and the receiver receives a corrupted version of the transmitted signal.  "
The receiver has the task of operating on the received signal.  
It reconstructs a recognisable form of the original message signal for delivering it to the user of information.  
There are two basic modes of communication: point-to-point and broadcast.  
"In point-to-point communication mode, communication takes place over a link between a single transmitter and a receiver.  "
Telephony is an example of such a mode of communication.  
"In contrast, in the broadcast mode, there are a large number of receivers corresponding to a single transmitter.  "
Radio and television are examples of broadcast mode of communication.  
"By now, we have become familiar with some terms like information source, transmitter, receiver, channel, noise, etc..  "
"It would be easy to understand the principles underlying any communication, if we get ourselves acquainted with the following basic terminology.  "
 -LRB- i -RRB-  Transducer: Any device that converts one form of energy into another can be termed as a transducer.  
"In electronic communication systems, we usually come across devices that have either their inputs or outputs in the electrical form.  "
"An electrical transducer may be defined as a device that converts some physical variable  -LRB- pressure, displacement, force, temperature, etc -RRB-  into corresponding variations in the electrical signal at its output.  "
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  Signal: Information converted in electrical form and suitable for transmission is called a signal.  
Signals can be either analog or digital.  
Analog signals are continuous variations of voltage or current.  
They are essentially single-valued functions of time.  
Sine wave is a fundamental analog signal.  
All other analog signals can be fully understood in terms of their sine wave components.  
Sound and picture signals in TV are analog in nature.  
Digital signals are those which can take only discrete stepwise values.  
Binary system that is extensively used in digital electronics employs just two levels of a signal.  
' 0 ' corresponds to a low level and ' 1 ' corresponds to a high level of voltage / current.  
There are several coding schemes useful for digital communication.  
They employ suitable combinations of number systems such as the binary coded decimal  -LRB- BCD -RRB- .  
"American Standard Code for Information Interchange  -LRB- ASCII -RRB-  is a universally popular digital code to represent numbers, letters and certain characters.  "
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  Noise: Noise refers to the unwanted signals that tend to disturb the transmission and processing of message signals in a communication system.  
The source generating the noise may be located inside or outside the system.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  Transmitter: A transmitter processes the incoming message signal so as to make it suitable for transmission through a channel and subsequent reception.  
This process is known as modulation.  
"As will be explained later, there are several types of modulation, abbreviated as AM, FM and PM.  "
 -LRB- xi -RRB-  Demodulation: The process of retrieval of information from the carrier wave at the receiver is termed demodulation.  
This is the reverse process of modulation.  
 -LRB- xii -RRB-  Repeater: A repeater is a combination of a receiver and a transmitter.  
"A repeater, picks up the signal from the transmitter, amplifies and retransmits it to the receiver sometimes with a change in carrier frequency.  "
Repeaters are used to extend the range of a communication system as shown in Fig. 15.2.  
A communication satellite is essentially a repeater station in space.  
"In a communication system, the message signal can be voice, music, picture or computer data.  "
Each of these signals has different ranges of frequencies.  
The type of communication system needed for a given signal depends on the band of frequencies which is considered essential for the communication process.  
"For speech signals, frequency range 300 Hz to 3100 Hz is considered adequate.  "
Therefore speech signal requires a bandwidth of 2800 Hz  -LRB- 3100 Hz — 300 Hz -RRB-  for commercial telephonic communication.  
"To transmit music, an approximate bandwidth of 20 kHz is required because of the high frequencies produced by the musical instruments.  "
The audible range of frequencies extends from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.  
Video signals for transmission of pictures require about 4.2 MHz of bandwidth.  
A TV signal contains both voice and picture and is usually allocated 6 MHz of bandwidth for transmission.  
"In the preceeding paragraph, we have considered only analog signals.  "
Digital signals are in the form of rectangular waves as shown in Fig. 15.3.  
"However, for practical purposes, the contribution from higher harmonics can be neglected, thus limiting the bandwidth.  "
"As a result, received waves are a distorted version of the transmitted one.  "
"If the bandwidth is large enough to accommodate a few harmonics, the information is not lost and the rectangular signal is more or less recovered.  "
"This is so because the higher the harmonic, less is its contribution to the wave form.  "
"Similar to message signals, different types of transmission media offer different bandwidths.  "
"The commonly used transmission media are wire, free space and fiber optic cable.  "
"Coaxial cable is a widely used wire medium, which offers a bandwidth of approximately 750 MHz.  "
Such cables are normally operated below 18 GHz.  
Communication through free space using radio waves takes place over a very wide range of frequencies: from a few hundreds of kHz to a few GHz.  
This range of frequencies is further subdivided and allocated for various services as indicated in Table 15.2.  
Optical communication using fibers is performed in the frequency range of 1 THz to 1000 THz  -LRB- microwaves to ultraviolet -RRB- .  
An optical fiber can offer a transmission bandwidth in excess of 100 GHz.  
Spectrum allocations are arrived at by an international agreement.  
The International Telecommunication Union  -LRB- ITU -RRB-  administers the present system of frequency allocations.  
"As the em wave travels away from the transmitter, the strength of the wave keeps on decreasing.  "
Several factors influence the propagation of em waves and the path they follow.  
"At this point, it is also important to understand the composition of the earth's atmosphere as it plays a vital role in the propagation of em waves.  "
A brief discussion on some useful layers of the atmosphere is given in Table 15.3.  
"To radiate signals with high efficiency, the antennas should have a size comparable to the wavelength λ of the signal  -LRB- at least ~ λ / 4 -RRB- .  "
"At longer wavelengths  -LRB- i.e., at lower frequencies -RRB- , the antennas have large physical size and they are located on or very near to the ground.  "
"In standard AM broadcast, ground based vertical towers are generally used as transmitting antennas.  "
"For such antennas, ground has a strong influence on the propagation of the signal.  "
The mode of propagation is called surface wave propagation and the wave glides over the surface of the earth.  
A wave induces current in the ground over which it passes and it is attenuated as a result of absorption of energy by the earth.  
The attenuation of surface waves increases very rapidly with increase in frequency.  
The maximum range of coverage depends on the transmitted power and frequency  -LRB- less than a few MHz -RRB- .  
"In the frequency range from a few MHz up to 30 to 40 MHz, long distance communication can be achieved by ionospheric reflection of radio waves back towards the earth.  "
This mode of propagation is called sky wave propagation and is used by short wave broadcast services.  
The ionosphere is so called because of the presence of a large number of ions or charged particles.  
It extends from a height of ~ 65 Km to about 400 Km above the earth's surface.  
Ionisation occurs due to the absorption of the ultraviolet and other high-energy radiation coming from the sun by air molecules.  
"The ionosphere is further subdivided into several layers, the details of which are given in Table 15.3.  "
The degree of ionisation varies with the height.  
The density of atmosphere decreases with height.  
At great heights the solar radiation is intense but there are few molecules to be ionised.  
"Close to the earth, even though the molecular concentration is very high, the radiation intensity is low so that the ionisation is again low.  "
"However, at some intermediate heights, there occurs a peak of ionisation density.  "
The ionospheric layer acts as a reflector for a certain range of frequencies  -LRB- 3 to 30 MHz -RRB- .  
Electromagnetic waves of frequencies higher than 30 MHz penetrate the ionosphere and escape.  
These phenomena are shown in the Fig. 15.4.  
The phenomenon of bending of em waves so that they are diverted towards the earth is similar to total internal reflection in optics.  
Another mode of radio wave propagation is by space waves.  
A space wave travels in a straight line from transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.  
Space waves are used for line-of-sight  -LRB- LOS -RRB-  communication as well as satellite communication.  
"At frequencies above 40 MHz, communication is essentially limited to line-of-sight paths.  "
"At these frequencies, the antennas are relatively smaller and can be placed at heights of many wavelengths above the ground.  "
"Because of line-of-sight nature of propagation, direct waves get blocked at some point by the curvature of the earth as illustrated in Fig. 15.5.  "
If the signal is to be received beyond the horizon then the receiving antenna must be high enough to intercept the line-of-sight waves.  
d t is also called the radio horizon of the transmitting antenna.  
"Television broadcast, microwave links and satellite communication are some examples of communication systems that use space wave mode of propagation.  "
Figure 15.6 summarises the various modes of wave propagation discussed so far.  
"As already mentioned, the purpose of a communication system is to transmit information or message signals.  "
"Message signals are also called baseband signals, which essentially designate the band of frequencies representing the original signal, as delivered by the source of information.  "
"No signal, in general, is a single frequency sinusoid, but it spreads over a range of frequencies called the signal bandwidth.  "
Suppose we wish to transmit an electronic signal in the audio frequency  -LRB- AF -RRB-  range  -LRB- baseband signal frequency less than 20 kHz -RRB-  over a long distance directly.  
Let us find what factors prevent us from doing so and how we overcome these factors.  
"For transmitting a signal, we need an antenna or an aerial.  "
"For an electromagnetic wave of frequency 20 kHz, the wavelength λ is 15 km.  "
"Obviously, such a long antenna is not possible to construct and operate.  "
Hence direct transmission of such baseband signals is not practical.  
"We can obtain transmission with reasonable antenna lengths if transmission frequency is high  -LRB- for example, if ν is 1 MHz, then λ is 300 m -RRB- .  "
"Therefore, there is a need of translating the information contained in our original low frequency baseband signal into high or radio frequencies before transmission.  "
A theoretical study of radiation from a linear antenna  -LRB- length l -RRB-  shows that the power radiated is proportional to  -LRB- l / λ -RRB-  2.  
"This implies that for the same antenna length, the power radiated increases with decreasing λ, i.e., increasing frequency.  "
"Hence, the effective power radiated by a long wavelength baseband signal would be small.  "
"For a good transmission, we need high powers and hence this also points out to the need of using high frequency transmission.  "
Another important argument against transmitting baseband signals directly is more practical in nature.  
Suppose many people are talking at the same time or many transmitters are transmitting baseband information signals simultaneously.  
All these signals will get mixed up and there is no simple way to distinguish between them.  
This points out towards a possible solution by using communication at high frequencies and allotting a band of frequencies to each message signal for its transmission.  
The above arguments suggest that there is a need for translating the original low frequency baseband message or information signal into high frequency wave before transmission  
such that the translated signal continues to possess the information contained in the original signal.  
"In doing so, we take the help of a high frequency signal, known as the carrier wave, and a process known as modulation which attaches information to it.  "
The carrier wave may be continuous  -LRB- sinusoidal -RRB-  or in the form of pulses as shown in Fig. 15.7.  
"During the process of modulation, any of the three parameters, viz A, ω and φ, of the carrier wave can be controlled by the message or information signal.  "
"In this chapter, we shall confine to amplitude modulation on ly.  "
In amplitude modulation the amplitude of the carrier is varied in accordance with the information signal.  
Here we explain amplitude modulation process using a sinusoidal signal as the modulating signal.  
"The modulated signal now consists of the carrier wave of frequency ω plus two sinusoidal waves each with a frequency slightly different from, known as side bands.  "
The frequency spectrum of the amplitude modulated signal is shown in Fig. 15.9.  
"As long as the broadcast frequencies  -LRB- carrier waves -RRB-  are sufficiently spaced out so that sidebands do not overlap, different stations can operate without interfering with each other.  "
Amplitude modulation can be produced by a variety of methods.  
It is to be mentioned that the modulated signal can not be transmitted as such.  
The transmitted message gets attenuated in propagating through the channel.  
The receiving antenna is therefore to be followed by an amplifier and a detector.  
"In addition, to facilitate further processing, the carrier frequency is usually changed to a lower frequency by what is called an intermediate frequency  -LRB- IF -RRB-  stage preceding the detection.  "
The detected signal may not be strong enough to be made use of and hence is required to be amplified.  
A block diagram of a typical receiver is shown in Fig. 15.12  
The modulated signal of the form given in  -LRB- a -RRB-  of fig. is passed through a rectifier to produce the output shown in  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
This envelope of signal  -LRB- b -RRB-  is the message signal.  
"In order to retrieve m  -LRB- t -RRB- , the signal is passed through an envelope detector  -LRB- which may consist of a simple RC circuit -RRB- .  "
In the present chapter we have discussed some basic concepts of communication and communication systems.  
We have also discussed one specific type of analog modulation namely Amplitude Modulation  -LRB- AM -RRB- .  
Other forms of modulation and digital communication systems play an important role in modern communication.  
These and other exciting developments are taking place everyday.  
So far we have restricted our discussion to some basic communication systems.  
It permits communication and sharing of all types of information between any two or more computers connected through a large and complex network.  
It was started in 1960's and opened for public use in 1990's.  
With the passage of time it has witnessed tremendous growth and it is still expanding its reach.  
Its applications include  -LRB- i -RRB-  E mail — It permits exchange of text/graphic material using email software.  
We can write a letter and send it to the recipient through ISP's  -LRB- Internet Service Providers -RRB-  who work like the dispatching and receiving post offices.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  File transfer — A FTP  -LRB- File Transfer Programmes -RRB-  allows transfer of files/software from one computer to another connected to the Internet.  
"Government departments, companies, NGO's  -LRB- Non-Government Organisations -RRB-  and individuals can post information about their activities for restricted or free use on their websites.  "
This information becomes accessible to the users.  
"Several search engines like Google, Yahoo! etc. help us in finding information by listing the related websites.  "
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  E-commerce — Use of the Internet to promote business using electronic means such as using credit cards is called E-commerce.  
Customers view images and receive all the information about various products or services of companies through their websites.  
They can do on-line shopping from home/office.  
Goods are dispatched or services are provided by the company through mail/courier.  
 -LRB- v -RRB-  Chat — Real time conversation among people with common interests through typed messages is called chat.  
Everyone belonging to the chat group gets the message instantaneously and can respond rapidly  
"It scans the contents of a document  -LRB- as an image, not text -RRB-  to create electronic signals.  "
These signals are then sent to the destination  -LRB- another FAX machine -RRB-  in an orderly manner using telephone lines.  
"At the destination, the signals are reconverted into a replica of the original document.  "
Note that FAX provides image of a static document unlike the image provided by television of objects that might be dynamic.  
Mobile telephony The concept of mobile telephony was developed first in 1970's and it was fully implemented in the following decade.  
The central concept of this system is to divide the service area into a suitable number of cells centred on an office called MTSO  -LRB- Mobile Telephone Switching Office -RRB- .  
Each cell contains a low-power transmitter called a base station and caters to a large number of mobile receivers  -LRB- popularly called cell phones -RRB- .  
Each cell could have a service area of a few square kilometers or even less depending upon the number of customers.  
"When a mobile receiver crosses the coverage area of one base station, it is necessary for the mobile user to be transferred to another base station.  "
This procedure is called handover or handoff.  
"This process is carried out very rapidly, to the extent that the consumer does not even notice it.  "
Mobile telephones operate typically in the UHF range of frequencies  -LRB- about 800-950 MHz -RRB- .
