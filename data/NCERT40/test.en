Every object experiences this force due to every other object in the universe.  
All objects on the earth, for example, experience the force of gravity due to the earth.  
In particular, gravity governs the motion of the moon and artificial satellites around the earth, motion of the earth and planets around the sun, and, of course, the motion of bodies falling to the earth.  
It plays a key role in the large-scale phenomena of the universe, such as formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and galactic clusters.  
Electromagnetic force is the force between charged particles.  
In the simpler case when charges are at rest, the force is given by Coulomb's law: attractive for unlike charges and repulsive for like charges.  
Charges in motion produce magnetic effects and a magnetic field gives rise to a force on a moving charge.  
Electric and magnetic effects are, in general, inseparable — hence the name electromagnetic force.  
Like the gravitational force, electromagnetic force acts over large distances and does not need any intervening medium.  
It is enormously strong compared to gravity.  
The systematic errors are those errors that tend to be in one direction, either positive or negative.  
 -LRB- a -RRB-  that arise from the errors due to imperfect design or calibration of the measuring instrument, zero error in the instrument, etc.  
For example, the temperature graduations of a thermometer may be inadequately calibrated  -LRB- it may read 104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP whereas it should read 100 °C -RRB- ; in a vernier callipers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may be worn off at one end.  
 -LRB- b -RRB-  To determine the temperature of a human body, a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature.  
Other external conditions  -LRB- such as changes in temperature, humidity, wind velocity, etc. -RRB-  during the experiment may systematically affect the measurement.  
 -LRB- c -RRB-  that arise due to an individual's bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus or individual's carelessness in taking observations without observing proper precautions, etc.  
For example, if you, by habit, always hold your head a bit too far to the right while reading the position of a needle on the scale, you will introduce an error due to parallax.  
Systematic errors can be minimized by improving experimental techniques, selecting better instruments and removing personal bias as far as possible.  
For a given set-up, these errors may be estimated to a certain extent and the necessary corrections may be applied to the readings.  
The random errors are those errors, which occur irregularly and hence are random with respect to sign and size.  
The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers  -LRB- or exponents -RRB-  to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity.  
Note that using the square brackets  -LSB-   -RSB-  round a quantity means that we are dealing with ' the dimensions of ' the quantity.  
In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions  -LSB- L -RSB- , [M] and [T].  
For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths.  
Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and -2 dimensions in time.  
The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero.  
Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered.  
It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters.  
Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity, average velocity, final velocity, and speed are all equivalent in this context.  
The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity is called the dimensional formula of the given physical quantity.  
Why so?  
The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion.  
How to describe this change?  
Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time?  
This was a problem even in Galileo's time.  
It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance.  
But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall.  
On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant — it decreases with the increasing distance of fall.  
It is the average change of velocity per unit time.  
The acceleration at an instant is the slope of the tangent to the v — t curve at that instant.  
These unit vectors are perpendicular to each other.  
Since we are dealing with motion in two dimensions in this chapter, we require use of only two unit vectors.  
Consider a vector A that lies in x-y plane as shown in Fig. 4.9 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
As is clear from Eq.  -LRB- 4.13 -RRB- , a component of a vector can be positive, negative or zero depending on the value of θ.  
Although the graphical method of adding vectors helps us in visualising the vectors and the resultant vector, it is sometimes tedious and has limited accuracy.  
It is much easier to add vectors by combining their respective components.  
Since vectors obey the commutative and associative laws, we can arrange and regroup the vectors in Eq.  -LRB- 4.19a -RRB-  as convenient to us.  
Thus, each component of the resultant vector R is the sum of the corresponding components of A and B.  
This method can be extended to addition and subtraction of any number of vectors. 
In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively.  
To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction.  
Newton's wording of the third law is so crisp and beautiful that it has become a part of common language.  
For the same reason perhaps, misconceptions about the third law abound.  
Let us note some important points about the third law, particularly in regard to the usage of the terms: action and reaction.  
1. The terms action and reaction in the third law mean nothing else but ' force '.  
Using different terms for the same physical concept can sometimes be confusing.  
Forces always occur in pairs.  
Force on a body A by B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.   
2. The terms action and reaction in the third law may give a wrong impression that action comes before reaction i.e action is the cause and reaction the effect.  
There is no cause-effect relation implied in the third law.  
 -LRB- v -RRB-  If necessary, follow the same procedure for another choice of the system.  
In doing so, employ Newton's third law.  
Note, the free-body diagram of the system does not show the internal forces between the block and the cylinder.  
For  -LRB- a -RRB- : (i) the force of gravity (20 N) on the block by the earth (say, action); the force of gravity on the earth by the block (reaction) equal to 20 N directed upwards (not shown in the figure).  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  the force on the floor by the block (action); the force on the block by the floor (reaction).  
For  -LRB- b -RRB- : (i) the force of gravity (270 N) on the system by the earth (say, action); the force of gravity on the earth by the system (reaction), equal to 270 N, directed upwards (not shown in the figure).  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  the force on the floor by the system (action); the force on the system by the floor (reaction).  
In addition, for  -LRB- b -RRB- , the force on the block by the cylinder and the force on the cylinder by the block also constitute an action-reaction pair.  
The important thing to remember is that an action-reaction pair consists of mutual forces which are always equal and opposite between two bodies.  
Two forces on the same body which happen to be equal and opposite can never constitute an action-reaction pair.  
In winter, in order to feel warm, we generate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms together.  
We shall see later that the internal energy is associated with the ceaseless, often random, motion of molecules.  
A quantitative idea of the transfer of heat energy is obtained by noting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J of energy when it cools by 10°C.  
One of the greatest technical achievements of humankind occurred when we discovered how to ignite and control fire.  
We learned to rub two flint stones together  -LRB- mechanical energy -RRB- , got them to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves (chemical energy), which then provided sustained warmth.  
A matchstick ignites into a bright flame when struck against a specially prepared chemical surface.  
The lighted matchstick, when applied to a firecracker, results in a spectacular display of sound and light.  
Chemical energy arises from the fact that the molecules participating in the chemical reaction have different binding energies.  
A stable chemical compound has less energy than the separated parts.  
A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement of atoms.  
In other words, the origin is a point of reflection symmetry for these bodies.  
As a result, the integrals in Eq.  -LRB- 7.5a -RRB-  all are zero.  
This means that for all the above bodies, their center of mass coincides with their geometric center.  
Let the masses 100g, 150g and 200g be located at O, A and B be respectively.  
The center of mass C is shown in the figure.  
Note that it is not the geometric center of the triangle OAB.  
The lamina  -LRB- ΔLMN -RRB-  may be subdivided into narrow strips each parallel to the base (MN) as shown in Fig. 7.10.  
By symmetry each strip has its center of mass at its midpoint.  
If we join the midpoint of all the strips we get the median LP.  
The center of mass of the triangle as a whole therefore, has to lie on the median LP.  
For this we first need to obtain some elementary cross products.  
We have used the elementary cross products in obtaining the above relation.  
The expression for a×b can be put in a determinant form which is easy to remember.  
In this section we shall study what is angular velocity and its role in rotational motion.  
We have seen that every particle of a rotating body moves in a circle.  
The linear velocity of the particle is related to the angular velocity.  
The relation between these two quantities involves a vector product which we learned about in the last section.  
Let us go back to Fig. 7.4.  
As said above, in rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its center on the axis.  
In Fig. 7.16 we redraw Fig. 7.4, showing a typical particle  -LRB- at a point P -RRB-  of the rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (taken as the z-axis).  
This then is the required form, for fixed axis rotation, of Eq.  -LRB- 7.29a -RRB- , which expresses the general law of conservation of angular momentum of a system of particles.  
Eq.  -LRB- 7.46 -RRB-  applies to many situations that we come across in daily life.  
You may do this experiment with your friend.  
Sit on a swivel chair with your arms folded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from, the ground.  
Ask your friend to rotate the chair rapidly.  
While the chair is rotating with considerable angular speed stretch your arms horizontally.  
What happens?  
Your angular speed is reduced.  
If you bring back your arms closer to your body, the angular speed increases again.  
This is a situation where the principle of conservation of angular momentum is applicable.  
A Geostationery satellite, appearing fixed above the broadcasting station can however receive these signals and broadcast them back to a wide area on earth.  
The INSAT group of satellites sent up by India are one such group of Geostationary satellites widely used for telecommunications in India.  
Another class of satellites are called the Polar satellites.  
Since its time period is around 100 minutes it crosses any altitude many times a day.  
However, since its height h above the earth is about 500-800 km, a camera fixed on it can view only small strips of the earth in one orbit.  
Adjacent strips are viewed in the next orbit, so that in effect the whole earth can be viewed strip by strip during the entire day.  
These satellites can view polar and equatorial regions at close distances with good resolution.  
Information gathered from such satellites is extremely useful for remote sensing, meterology as well as for environmental studies of the earth.  
Weight of an object is the force with which the earth attracts it.  
We are conscious of our own weight when we stand on a surface, since the surface exerts a force opposite to our weight to keep us at rest.  
It consists of an evacuated chamber with a spring that is calibrated to measure the force acting on the piston.  
This device is placed at a point inside the fluid.  
The inward force exerted by the fluid on the piston is balanced by the outward spring force and is thereby measured.  
If F is the magnitude of this normal force on the piston of area A then the average pressure P av area ;  -LRB- 10.1 -RRB-  STP means standard temperature and 1 atm pressure ; In principle, the piston area can be made arbitrarily small.  
We remind the reader that it is the component of the force normal to the area under consideration and not the  -LRB- vector -RRB-  force that appears in the numerator in Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2).  
Its dimensions are  -LRB- ML — 1 T — 2 -RRB- .  
The SI unit of pressure is N m — 2.  
It has been named as pascal  -LRB- Pa -RRB-  in honor of the French scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who carried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure.  
A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere  -LRB- atm -RRB- , i.e. the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 × 10 5 Pa).  
Another quantity, that is indispensable in describing fluids, is the density ρ.  
Then from Eq. 10.24 and the discussion given there, the surface tension of the liquid-air interface is S la where m is the extra mass and l is the length of la =  -LRB- W / 2 l -RRB-  = (mg / 2 l) (10.25) the plate edge ; The subscript (la) emphasises the fact that the liquid-air interface tension is involved.  
Angle of Contact The surface of liquid near the plane of contact, with another medium is in general curved.  
The angle between tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact and solid surface inside the liquid is termed as angle of contact.  
It is denoted by θ.  
It is different at interfaces of different pairs of liquids and solids.  
The value of θ determines whether a liquid will spread on the surface of a solid or it will form droplets on it.  
For example, water forms droplets on lotus leaf as shown in Fig. 10.19  -LRB- a -RRB-  while spreads over a clean plastic plate as shown in Fig. 10.19 (b).  
This is what happens with water on a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on any surface.  
On the other hand, if the molecules of the liquid are strongly attracted to those of the solid, this will reduce S sl and therefore, θ may increase or θ may decrease.  
In this and therefore, case θ is an acute angle ; This is what happens for water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene oil on virtually anything  -LRB- it just spreads -RRB- .  
For liquids, the coefficient of volume expansion is relatively independent of the temperature.  
However, for gases it is dependent on temperature.  
Soon you will notice that bubbles begin to move upward.  
As the temperature is raised the motion of water particles increases till it becomes turbulent as water starts boiling.  
What are the factors on which the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance depend?  
In order to answer this question in the first step, heat a given quantity of water to raise its temperature by, say 20 ° C and note the time taken.  
Again take the same amount of water and raise its temperature by 40 ° C using the same source of heat ; Note the time taken by using a stopwatch.  
You will find it takes about twice the time and therefore, double the quantity of heat required raising twice the temperature of same amount of water.  
In the second step, now suppose you take double the amount of water and heat it, using the same heating arrangement, to raise the temperature by 20 ° C, you will find the time taken is again twice that required in the first step.  
In the third step, in place of water, now heat the same quantity of some oil, say mustard oil, and raise the temperature again by 20 ° C. Now note the time by the same stopwatch.  
To summarise, heat and work in thermodynamics are not state variables.  
They are modes of energy transfer to a system resulting in change in its internal energy, which, as already mentioned, is a state variable.  
In ordinary language, we often confuse heat with internal energy.  
The distinction between them is sometimes ignored in elementary physics books.  
 -LRB- b -RRB-  If the same box is moving as a whole with some velocity, the kinetic energy of the box is not to be included in U.  
Work is energy transfer brought about by means  -LRB- e.g. moving the piston by raising or lowering some weight connected to it -RRB-  that do not involve such a temperature difference.  
We have seen that the internal energy U of a system can change through two modes of energy transfer: heat and work.  
It is simply the general law of conservation of energy applied to any system in which the energy transfer from or to the surroundings is taken into account.  
Alternatively, we can the pressure constant.  
Since U is a state variable, Δ U depends only on the initial and final states and not on the path taken by the gas to go from one to the other.  
Heat engine is a device by which a system is made to undergo a cyclic process that results in conversion of heat to work.  
 -LRB- 1 -RRB-  It consists of a working substance — the system.  
For example, a mixture of fuel vapor and air in a gasoline or diesel engine or steam in a steam engine are the working substances.  
 -LRB- 2 -RRB-  The working substance goes through a cycle consisting of several processes.  
 -LRB- 4 -RRB-  The work done (W ) by the system in a cycle is transferred to the environment via some is transferred to the environment via some arrangement.  
Example the working substance may be in a cylinder with a moving piston that transfers mechanical energy to the wheels of a vehicle via a shaft -RRB- .  
The basic features of a heat engine are schematically represented in Fig. 12.9.  
The cycle is repeated again and again to get useful work for some purpose.  
The discipline of thermodynamics has its roots in the study of heat engines.  
A basic question relates to the efficiency of a heat engine.  
This is also the increase in the amount of volume available for each molecule of water.  
When volume increases by 103 times the radius increases by V1/3 or 10 times, i.e., 10×2 Å = 20 Å.  
So the average distance is 2 × 20 = 40 Å.  
Partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is the pressure it would have for the same volume and temperature if it alone occupied the vessel ;  -LRB- The total pressure of a mixture of non-reactive gases is the sum of partial pressures due to its constituent gases. -RRB-   
Each gas  -LRB- assumed ideal -RRB-  obeys the gas law.  
A given amount of gas is a collection of a large number of molecules  -LRB- typically of the order of Avogadro's number -RRB-  that are in incessant random motion.  
At ordinary pressure and temperature, the average distance between molecules is a factor of 10 or more than the typical size of a molecule  -LRB- 2 Å -RRB- .  
Thus the interaction between the molecules is negligible and we can assume that they move freely in straight lines according to Newton's first law ; However, occasionally, they come close to each other, experience intermolecular forces and their velocities change.  
These interactions are called collisions.  
The molecules collide incessantly against each other or with the walls and change their velocities.  
In this figure, the curves 3 and 4 represent plots of Eq. -LRB- 14.4 -RRB-  for two values of the phase constant φ.  
It can be seen that the phase constant signifies the initial conditions.  
The constant ω, called the angular frequency of the motion, is related to the period T.  
Now since the motion is periodic with a period T, the displacement x -LRB- t -RRB-  must return to its initial value after one period of the motion; that is, x(t) must be equal to x(t+T) for all t.  
The SI unit of angular frequency is radians per second.  
To illustrate the significance of period T, sinusoidal functions with two different periods are plotted in Fig.14.8.  
In this plot the SHM represented by curve a, has a period T and that represented by curve b, has a period T = T/2.  
We have had an introduction to simple harmonic motion.  
In the next section we will discuss the simplest example of simple harmonic motion.  
It will be shown that the projection of uniform circular motion on a diameter of the circle executes simple harmonic motion.  
This is just half of the decay period for amplitude.  
This is not suprising, because, according to Eqs.  -LRB- 14.33 -RRB-  and (14.35), energy depends on the square of the amplitude.  
Notice that there is a factor of 2 in the exponents of the two exponentials.  
A person swinging in a swing without anyone pushing it or a simple pendulum, displaced and released, are examples of free oscillations.  
In both the cases, the amplitude of swing will gradually decrease and the system would, ultimately, come to a halt.  
Because of the ever-present dissipative forces, the free oscillations can not be sustained in practice.  
They get damped as seen in section 14.9.  
However, while swinging in a swing if you apply a push periodically by pressing your feet against the ground, you find that not only the oscillations can now be maintained but the amplitude can also be increased.  
Under this condition the swing has forced, or driven, oscillations.  
In case of a system executing driven oscillations under the action of a harmonic force, two angular frequencies are important:  -LRB- 1 -RRB-  the natural angular frequency ω of the system, which is the angular frequency at which it will oscillate if it were displaced from equilibrium position and then left to oscillate freely, and (2) the angular frequency ωd of the external force causing the driven oscillations.  
The ratio Δx/Δt is the wave speed v.  
As the wave moves  -LRB- see Fig. 15.8 -RRB- , each point of the moving waveform represents a particular phase of the wave and retains its displacement y.  
It may be noted that the points on the string do not retain their displacement, but the points on the waveform do.  
Let us consider a point like A marked on a peak of the waveform.  
If a point like A on the wave form retains its displacement as it moves, it follows from Eq. -LRB- 15.2 -RRB-  that this is possible only when the argument is constant.  
Note that in the argument both x and t are changing; therefore, to keep the argument constant, if t increases, x must also increase.  
This is possible only when the wave is moving in the positive direction of x.  
Equation  -LRB- 15.11 -RRB-  is a general relation valid for all progressive waves.  
It merely states that the wave moves a distance of one wavelength in one period of oscillation.  
The speed of a wave is related to its wavelength and frequency by the Eq. -LRB- 15.12 -RRB- , but it is determined by the properties of the medium.  
In this reference frame the source and medium are approaching at speed vo and the speed with which the wave approaches is vo + v.  
If v0/v is small, the Doppler shift is almost same whether it is the observer or the source moving since Eq. -LRB- 15.53 -RRB-  and the approximate relation Eq.(15.51) are the same.  
We will now derive a general expression for Doppler shift when both the source and the and this reaches the observer at time observer are moving.  
As before, let us take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction.  
Let the source and the observer be moving with velocities vs and vo respectively as shown in Fig.15.18 ; Suppose at time t = 0, the observer is at O1 and the source is at S1, O1 being to the left of S1.  
The source emits a wave of velocity v, of frequency v and period T0 all measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium.  
Let L be the distance between O1 and S1 at t = 0, when the source emits the first crest.  
Now, since the observer is moving, the velocity of the wave relative to the observer is v + v0.  
Therfore the first crest reaches the observer at time t1 = L/ -LRB- v + v0 -RRB- .  
At time t = T0, both the observer and the source have moved to their new positions O2 and S2 respectively.  
Thus charge q on a body is always given by q = ne where n is any integer, positive or negative.  
This basic unit of charge is the charge that an electron or proton carries.  
By convention, the charge on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written as — e and that on a proton as + e.  
The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed as quantisation of charge.  
There are a large number of situations in physics where certain physical quantities are quantised.  
The quantisation of charge was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by English experimentalist Faraday.  
It was experimentally demonstrated by Millikan in 1912.  
In the International System  -LRB- SI -RRB-  of Units, a unit of charge is called a coulomb and is denoted by the symbol C.  
A coulomb is defined in terms the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent chapter.  
In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge flowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A  -LRB- ampere -RRB- , (see Chapter 2 of Class XI, Physics Textbook, Part I).  
We can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and S normal to the field lines there.  
The number of field lines in our picture cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at these points.  
The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.  
To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather the solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the area with the solid angle, a generalization of angle to three dimensions.  
Recall how a  -LRB- plane -RRB-  angle is defined in two-dimensions.  
Let a small transverse line element Δ l be placed at a distance r from a point O.  
Then the angle subtended by Δ l at O can be approximated as Δ θ = Δ l / r.  
Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle subtended by a small perpendicular plane area Δ S, at a distance r, can be written as ΔΩ = Δ S / r.  
We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial field lines is the same.  
In Fig. 1.16, for two points P and P at distances r and r from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle ΔΩ ΔΩ at P and an element of area ΔΩ at P, respectively.  
However, at distances much larger than the separation of the two charges forming a dipole  -LRB- r  _GREAT_GT;   _GREAT_GT;  2 a -RRB- , the fields due to q and — q nearly cancel out.  
The electric field due to a dipole therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1 / r  -LRB- the dependence on r of the field due to a single charge q -RRB- .  
These qualitative ideas are borne out by the explicit calculation as follows: The electric field of the pair of charges  -LRB- — q and q -RRB-  at any point in space can be found out from Coulomb's law and the superposition principle.  
The results are simple for the following two cases:  -LRB- i -RRB-  when the point is on the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane of the dipole, i.e., on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its center.  
The electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric fields E due to the charge — q and E due to the charge q, by the parallelogram law of vectors.  
 -LRB- i -RRB-  For points on the axis Let the point P be at distance r from the center of the dipole on the side of the charge q, as shown in Fig. 1.20 (a).  
Then  -LRB- 1.13 (a -RRB- ) where is the unit vector along the dipole axis (from — q to q).  
Also  -LRB- 1.13 (b -RRB- ) The total field at P is (1.14) For r  _GREAT_GT;   _GREAT_GT;  a (r  _GREAT_GT;   _GREAT_GT;  a) (1.15) (ii) For points on the equatorial plane The magnitudes of the electric fields due to the two charges + q and — q are given by (1.16 (a)) (1.16 (b)) and are equal.  
The directions of E and E are as shown in Fig. 1.20  -LRB- b -RRB- .  
Clearly, the components normal to the dipole axis cancel away.  
When the external force is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing an equal amount of potential energy.  
The sum of kinetic and potential energies is thus conserved.  
Forces of this kind are called conservative forces.  
Spring force and gravitational force are examples of conservative forces.  
Coulomb force between two  -LRB- stationary -RRB-  charges, like the gravitational force, is also a conservative force.  
This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence on distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants — the masses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb's law.  
Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational field, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an electrostatic field.  
Consider an electrostatic field E due to some charge configuration.  
First, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the origin.  
Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a point P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q.  
 -LRB- For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero even at the surface. -RRB-   
See result 5.  
The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in the static situation A neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges in every small volume or surface element.  
When the conductor is charged, the excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.  
This follows from the Gauss's law.  
Consider any arbitrary volume element v inside a conductor.  
On the closed surface S bounding the volume element v, electrostatic field is zero.  
Thus the total electric flux through S is zero.  
Hence, by Gauss's law, there is no net charge enclosed by S.  
But the surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be made vanishingly small.  
These materials, generally called conductors, develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.  
If we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly bound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons.  
There are, however, other types of conductors like electrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.  
In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background of fixed positive ions.  
Consider first the case when no electric field is present.  
The electrons will be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the fixed ions.  
An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed as before the collision.  
However, the direction of its velocity after the collision is completely random.  
At a given time, there is no preferential direction for the velocities of the electrons.  
Thus on the average, the number of electrons traveling in any direction will be equal to the number of electrons traveling in the opposite direction.  
Thus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under the action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they move.  
We have, however, seen earlier that on the average, charge carriers do not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity.  
This is because of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit.  
During collisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.  
The atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up.  
It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an electric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.  
Where does the power come from?  
As we have reasoned before, we need an external source to keep a steady current through the conductor.  
It is clearly this source which must supply this power.  
In the simple circuit shown with a cell  -LRB- Fig.3.12 -RRB- , it is the chemical energy of the cell which supplies this power for as long as it can.  
A smaller unit  -LRB- non-SI -RRB-  called gauss (=10—4 tesla) is also often used.  
The force on a positively charged particle with velocity v and making an angle θ with the magnetic field B is given by the right-hand rule.  
A moving charged particle q is deflected in an opposite sense to —q in the presence of magnetic field.  
We can extend the analysis for force due to magnetic field on a single moving charge to a straight rod carrying current.  
Consider a rod of a uniform cross-sectional area A and length l.  
We shall assume one kind of mobile carriers as in a conductor  -LRB- here electrons -RRB- .  
Let the number density of these mobile charge carriers in it be n ; Then the total number of mobile charge carriers in it is nAl.  
For a steady current I in this conducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average drift velocity vd  -LRB- see Chapter 3 -RRB- .  
Note that the current I is not a vector.  
In the last step leading to Eq.  -LRB- 4.4 -RRB- , we have transferred the vector sign from j to l.  
Ampere's law states that this integral is equal to µ0 times the total current passing through the surface.  
Now, let L be the length  -LRB- part -RRB-  of the loop for which B is tangential.  
Let Ie be the current enclosed by the loop.  
When there is a system with a symmetry such as for a straight infinite current-carrying wire in Fig. 4.15, the Ampere's law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic field, much the same way Gauss' law helps in determination of the electric field.  
This is exhibited in the Example 4.8 below.  
The boundary of the loop chosen is a circle and magnetic field is tangential to the circumference of the circle.  
In other words, the magnetic field possesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry ; The field that normally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r.  
Whenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify.  
The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it.  
Thus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field form concentric circles.  
Any small rotation of the coil produces a torque which brings it back to its original position.  
When they are antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces a torque which increases with the amount of rotation.  
The presence of this torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole aligns itself with the external magnetic field.  
We shall show that the magnetic field  -LRB- at large distances -RRB-  due to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behavior to the electric field of an electric dipole.  
In Section 4.6, we have evaluated the magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying a steady current I.  
The magnitude of this field is  -LRB- (Eq. (4.15 -RRB- ), µ and its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb rule.  
Here, x is the distance along the axis from the center of the loop.  
This led Ampere to suggest that all magnetism is due to circulating currents.  
This seems to be partly true and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far.  
However, elementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic magnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.  
The arrangement of iron filings surrounding a bar magnet.  
The pattern mimics magnetic field lines.  
The pattern suggests that the bar magnet is a magnetic dipole.  
In some textbooks the magnetic field lines are called magnetic lines of force.  
This nomenclature is avoided since it can be confusing.  
Unlike electrostatics the field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a  -LRB- moving -RRB-  charge.  
At large distances, the field lines are very similar.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  The larger the number of field lines crossing per unit area, the stronger is the magnitude of the magnetic field B.  
In Fig. 5.3  -LRB- a -RRB- , B is larger around region ii than in region i.  
 -LRB- iv -RRB-  The magnetic field lines do not intersect, for if they did, the direction of the magnetic field would not be unique at the point of intersection.  
Substances which at room temperature retain their ferromagnetic property for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.  
Permanent magnets can be made in a variety of ways.  
One can hold an iron rod in the north-south direction and hammer it repeatedly.  
The method is illustrated in Fig. 5.15.  
The illustration is from a 400 year old book to emphasise that the making of permanent magnets is an old art.  
One can also hold a steel rod and stroke it with one end of a bar magnet a large number of times, always in the same sense to make a permanent magnet.  
An efficient way to make a permanent magnet is to place a ferromagnetic rod in a solenoid and pass a current.  
The magnetic field of the solenoid magnetises the rod.  
The hysteresis curve  -LRB- Fig. 5.14 -RRB-  allows us to select suitable materials for permanent magnets.  
The material should have high retentivity so that the magnet is strong and high coercivity so that the magnetisation is not erased by stray magnetic fields, temperature fluctuations or minor mechanical damage.  
We have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.  
However, the relation is far more general.  
Note that if the inner solenoid was much shorter than  -LRB- and placed well inside -RRB-  the outer solenoid, then we could still have calculated the flux linkage N1Φ1 because the inner solenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the outer solenoid.  
In this case, the calculation of M12 would be easy.  
However, it would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer solenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across the length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid.  
Therefore, the calculation of M21 would also be extremely difficult in this case.  
The equality M12 = M21 is very useful in such situations.  
We explained the above example with air as the medium within the solenoids.  
It is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of coils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative orientation.  
Now, let us recollect Experiment 6.3 in Section 6.2.  
The electric mains supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function with time.  
Such a voltage is called alternating voltage  -LRB- ac voltage -RRB-  and the current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac current).  
Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.  
This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current.  
The main reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by means of transformers.  
Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted economically over long distances.  
AC circuits exhibit characteristics which are exploited in many devices of daily use.  
For example, whenever we tune our radio to a favorite station, we are taking advantage of a special property of ac circuits — one of many that you will study in this chapter.  
The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant, respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating current current.  
Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity displaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted that we follow others in its use.  
So, larger the value of Q, the smaller is the value of 2Δω or the bandwidth and sharper is the resonance.  
We see from Fig. 7.15, that if the resonance is less sharp, not only is the maximum current less, the circuit is close to resonance for a larger range Δω of frequencies and the tuning of the circuit will not be good.  
So, less sharp the resonance, less is the selectivity of the circuit or vice versa.  
From Eq.  -LRB- 7.36 -RRB- , we see that if quality factor is large, i.e., R is low or L is large, the circuit is more selective.  
The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in R.H.S. of Eq.  -LRB- 7.37 -RRB- .  
It is only the second term which is time-dependent ; Its average is zero  -LRB- the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative half -RRB- .  
So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and current but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them.  
The quantity cos φ is called the power factor.  
Let us discuss the following cases: Case  -LRB- i -RRB-  Resistive circuit: If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called resistive.  
In that case φ = 0, cos φ = 1 ; There is maximum power dissipation.  
If there are, on this plane, electric charges, they will be set and sustained in motion by the electric and magnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave. 
The charges thus acquire energy and momentum from the waves. 
This just illustrates the fact that an electromagnetic wave  -LRB- like other waves -RRB-  carries energy and momentum. 
Since it carries momentum, an electromagnetic wave also exerts pressure, called radiation pressure. 
If the total energy transferred to a surface in time t is U, it can be shown that the magnitude of the total momentum delivered to this surface  -LRB- for complete absorption -RRB-  is, (8.12). When the sun shines on your hand, you feel the energy being absorbed from the electromagnetic waves (your hands get warm). 
Electromagnetic waves also transfer momentum to your hand but because c is very large, the amount of momentum transferred is extremely small and you do not feel the pressure. 
In 1903, the American scientists Nicols and Hull succeeded in measuring radiation pressure of visible light and verified Eq.  -LRB- 8.12 -RRB- . 
It was found to be of the order of 7×10—6 N/m2. 
Thus, on a surface of area 10 cm2, the force due to radiation is only about 7×10—9 N. The great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems from their capability to carry energy from one place to another. 
The radio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. 
However, later on it was discovered that the speed of light is less in water or glass than in air.  
In the field of optics, Newton — the experimenter, was greater than Newton — the theorist.  
He himself observed many phenomena, which were difficult to understand in terms of particle nature of light.  
For example, the colors observed due to a thin film of oil on water.  
Property of partial reflection of light is yet another such example.  
Everyone who has looked into the water in a pond sees image of the face in it, but also sees the bottom of the pond.  
Newton argued that some of the corpuscles, which fall on the water, get reflected and some get transmitted.  
Newton had to postulate some kind of unpredictable, chance phenomenon, which decided whether an individual corpuscle would be reflected or not.  
In explaining other phenomena, however, the corpuscles were presumed to behave as if they are identical.  
Such a dilemma does not occur in the wave picture of light.  
It is found that the violet light emerges at an angle of 40º related to the incoming sunlight and red light emerges at an angle of 42º.  
For other colors, angles lie in between these two values.  
Figure 9.27  -LRB- b -RRB-  explains the formation of primary rainbow.  
We see that red light from drop 1 and violet light from drop 2 reach the observers eye.  
The violet from drop 1 and red light from drop 2 are directed at level above or below the observer.  
Thus the observer sees a rainbow with red color on the top and violet on the bottom.  
Thus, the primary rainbow is a result of three-step process, that is, refraction, reflection and refraction.  
When light rays undergoes two internal reflections inside a raindrop, instead of one as in the primary rainbow, a secondary rainbow is formed as shown in Fig. 9.27  -LRB- c -RRB- .  
It is due to four-step process.  
The intensity of light is reduced at the second reflection and hence the secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary rainbow.  
Telescopes with mirror objectives are called chromatic aberration in a mirror.  
Second, if a parabolic reflecting surface is chosen, spherical aberration is also removed.  
Mechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs much less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported over its entire back surface, not just over its rim.  
One obvious problem with a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside the telescope tube.  
The viewer sits near the focal point of the mirror, in a small cage.  
Another solution to the problem is to deflect the light being focussed by another mirror.  
One such arrangement using a convex secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes through a hole in the objective primary mirror, is shown in Fig. 9.33.  
This is known as a Cassegrain telescope, after its inventor.  
It has the advantages of a large focal length in a short telescope.  
The largest telescope in India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu.  
The center of the central bright fringe will appear at a point which lies on the straight line SS 1 or SS 2, as the case may be.  
We now compare and contrast the interference pattern with that seen for a coherently illuminated single slit  -LRB- usually called the single slit diffraction pattern -RRB- .  
 -LRB- i -RRB-  The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands.  
The diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum which is twice as wide as the other maxima.  
The intensity falls as we go to successive maxima away from the center, on either side.  
 -LRB- ii -RRB-  We calculate the interference pattern by superposing two waves originating from the two narrow slits.  
The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit.  
 -LRB- iii -RRB-  For a single slit of width a, the first null of the interference pattern occurs at an angle of λ / a.  
At the same angle of λ / a, we get a maximum  -LRB- not a null -RRB-  for two narrow slits separated by a distance a.  
One must understand that both d and a have to be quite small, to be able to observe good interference and diffraction patterns.  
When light is incident on an interface of two media, it is observed that some part of it gets reflected and some part gets transmitted.  
Consider a related question: Is it possible that under some conditions a monochromatic beam of light incident on a surface  -LRB- which is normally reflective -RRB-  gets completely transmitted with no reflection?  
To your surprise, the answer is yes.  
Let us try a simple experiment and check what happens.  
Arrange a laser, a good polariser, a prism and screen as shown in the figure here.  
Now rotate the polariser carefully and  
you will observe that for a specific alignment of the polariser, the light incident on the prism is completely transmitted and no light is reflected from the surface of the prism.  
The reflected spot will completely vanish.  
Figure 10.23  -LRB- b -RRB-  shows light reflected from a transparent medium, say, water.  
As before, the dots and arrows indicate that both polarisations are present in the incident and refracted waves.  
This value was close to the value of Planck's contant determined in an entirely different context.  
In this way, in 1916, Millikan proved the validity of Einstein's photoelectric equation, instead of disproving it.  
Millikan verified photoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals over a wide range of radiation frequencies.  
Photoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in interaction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of energy, each of energy h ν.  
Is the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle?  
Einstein arrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be associated with momentum  -LRB- h ν / c -RRB- .  
A definite value of energy as well as momentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated with a particle.  
This particle was later named photon.  
The particle-like behavior of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of A.H. Compton  -LRB- 1892-1962 -RRB-  on scattering of X-rays from electrons.  
In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect.  
In such gases, the average spacing between atoms is large.  
Hence, the radiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms rather than because of interactions between atoms or molecules.  
In the early nineteenth century it was also established that each element is associated with a characteristic spectrum of radiation,  
for example, hydrogen always gives a set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines.  
This fact suggested an intimate relationship between the internal structure of an atom and the spectrum of radiation emitted by it.  
In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer  -LRB- 1825 — 1898 -RRB-  obtained a simple empirical formula which gave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic hydrogen.  
Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements known, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this chapter.  
Ernst Rutherford  -LRB- 1871 — 1937 -RRB- , a former research student of J. J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on α-particles emitted by some radioactive elements.  
In 1906, he proposed a classic experiment of scattering of these α-particles by atoms to investigate the atomic structure.  
This experiment was later performed around 1911 by Hans Geiger  -LRB- 1882 — 1945 -RRB-  and Ernst Marsden (1889 — 1970, who was 20 year-old student and had not yet earned his bachelor's degree).  
However only those wavelengths survive which have nodes at the ends and form the standing wave in the string.  
It means that in a string, standing waves are formed when the total distance traveled by a wave down the string and back is one wavelength, two wavelengths, or any integral number of wavelengths.  
Waves with other wavelengths interfere with themselves upon reflection and their amplitudes quickly drop to zero.  
For an electron moving in n circular orbit of radius r n, the total distance is the circumference of the orbit, 2 π r n.  
Figure 12.10 illustrates a standing particle wave on a circular orbit for, i.e.,  
where λ is the de Broglie wavelength of the electron moving in n orbit.  
From Chapter 11, we have λ = h/p, where p is the magnitude of the electron's momentum.  
If the speed of the electron is much less than the speed of light, the momentum is mv n.  
Thus, λ = h/mv n.  
From Eq.  -LRB- 12.24 -RRB- , we have  
These structures are called the diamond-like structures.  
Each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbors.  
We know that Si and Ge have four valence electrons.  
In its crystalline structure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its four valence electrons with each of its four nearest neighbor atoms, and also to take share of one electron from each such neighbor.  
These shared electron pairs are referred to as forming a covalent bond or simply a valence bond.  
The two shared electrons can be assumed to shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms holding them together strongly.  
Figure 14.4 schematically shows the 2-dimensional representation of Si or Ge structure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the covalent bond.  
It shows an idealised picture in which no bonds are broken  -LRB- all bonds are intact -RRB- .  
Such a situation arises at low temperatures.  
As the temperature increases, more thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of these electrons may break—away  -LRB- becoming free electrons contributing to conduction -RRB- .  
If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage of the rectified output.  
When there is a load, it gets discharged through the load and the voltage across it begins to fall.   
In the section, we shall discuss some devices which are basically junction diodes but are developed for different applications.  
It is a special purpose semiconductor diode, named after its inventor C. Zener.  
It is designed to operate under reverse bias in the breakdown region and used as a voltage regulator.  
The symbol for Zener diode is shown in Fig. 14.21 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
Zener diode is fabricated by heavily doping both p-, and n-sides of the junction.  
Due to this, depletion region formed is very thin  -LRB-  _LESS_LT;  10—6 m -RRB-  and the electric field of the junction is extremely high (~5 × 106 V/m) even for a small reverse bias voltage of about 5V.  
The I-V characteristics of a Zener diode is shown in Fig. 14.21 -LRB- b -RRB- .  
It is seen that when the applied reverse bias voltage  -LRB- V -RRB-  reaches the breakdown voltage (Vz) of the Zener diode, there is a large change in the current.  
Since the transistor is operated as an amplifier over large range of VCE, the reverse bias across the base-collector junction is high most of the time.  
Therefore, the input characteristics may be obtained for VCE somewhere in the range of 3 V to 20 V.  
Since the increase in VCE appears as increase in VCB, its effect on IB is negligible.  
As a consequence, input characteristics for various values of VCE will give almost identical curves.  
Hence, it is enough to determine only one input characteristics.  
The input characteristics of a transistor is as shown in Fig. 14.30 -LRB- a -RRB- .  
The output characteristic is obtained by observing the variation of IC as VCE is varied keeping IB constant.  
It is obvious that if VBE is increased by a small amount, both hole current from the emitter region and the electron current from the base region will increase.  
As a consequence both IB and IC will increase proportionately.  
This shows that when IB increases IC also increases.  
 -LRB- v -RRB-  Receiver: A receiver extracts the desired message signals from the received signals at the channel output.  
 -LRB- vi -RRB-  Attenuation: The loss of strength of a signal while propagating through a medium is known as attenuation.  
 -LRB- vii -RRB-  Amplification: It is the process of increasing the amplitude (and consequently the strength) of a signal using an electronic circuit called the amplifier (reference Chapter 14).  
Amplification is necessary to compensate for the attenuation of the signal in communication systems.  
The energy needed for additional signal strength is obtained from a DC power source.  
Amplification is done at a place between the source and the destination wherever signal strength becomes weaker than the required strength.  
 -LRB- viii -RRB-  Range: It is the largest distance between a source and a destination up to which the signal is received with sufficient strength.  
 -LRB- ix -RRB-  Bandwidth: Bandwidth refers to the frequency range over which an equipment operates or the portion of the spectrum occupied by the signal.  
 -LRB- x -RRB-  Modulation: The original low frequency message/information signal can not be transmitted to long distances because of reasons given in Section 15.7.  
Therefore, at the transmitter, information contained in the low frequency message signal is superimposed on a high frequency wave, which acts as a carrier of the information.
